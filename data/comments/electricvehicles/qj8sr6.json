If big OEMs like BMW and Toyota assert that the hope isn&#39;t there, then yes there&#39;s a strong chance the EV transition won&#39;t be achieved even mostly if not fully. But if they jumped aboard then yes the transition could be achieved. At least Toyota and BMW are becoming more the minority of OEM CEOs who are resistant to the EV transition.<\/p>\n\n<p>Hopefully the iX, i4, and later successors knock it out of the park so Zipse has no choice but to prioritize EVs going forward.<\/p>\n<\/div>","11":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Climate change deniers will not look for solutions.  The world is making great strides to move to clean energy and there will become a point where clean energy will be more cost effective and abundant that the older methods of creating electrical power.   The modern EV transition is relatively new and there will be some major advancements in the near future such as solid state which offers longer range, lower weight and extended life which will make EVs even more appealing to the masses.  Combine better EVs with cheaper electricity and only historians will have ICE cars to show future generations how evolution in technologies looks.

This takes into account the environmental impact of manufacturing batteries and all other components. <\/p>\n\n<p>The interesting part was how that shifts in the worst case scenarios. They took the Model S, which is at the time had the highest environmental impact because it had the largest battery, and calculated the pollution from the dirtiest power source, which would be coal-heavy West Virginia. That shifted the break even as far out as 17 years, so if you&#39;re electricity comes from really bad sources and you have a huge battery, that is the only scenario where he may have a point, but it&#39;s a very niche case. <\/p>\n\n<p>As coal becomes less and less cost effective and more plants go offline, this entire line of thinking becomes moot.<\/p>\n<\/div>","19":"<div class=\"md\"><p>It is true that EVs powered by electricity produced from coal only get 25mpge versus 58mgpe for natural gas. But coal electricity production has been falling in the US.<\/p>\n<\/div>","20":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Stocks are just a scam anyways.

When the technology shifts happening if you are not ready cannibalize your own products you will not survive. <\/p>\n\n<p>They are developing many BEV models but very limited production. There are no plans to increase production drastically in the near future. Even by 2030, they expect ICEs to make up majority of their sales. Good luck with that.<\/p>\n<\/div>","22":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Their attitude is great actually. Their goal is to make the most sustainable EVs in terms of production emissions. The plant where the iX and the i4 are made runs on 100% hydro. They are using EESM electric motors instead of PMS so no rare earths. Recycled aluminium, recycled floor mats, recycled nickel (50%) in the iX and i4 battery. Just started using a new paint method that uses 70% less energy. Gave a deadline to suppliers requiring that they also have to use 100% renewable energy or they will be dropped as a supplier. Developing a lot of sustainable materials that are already in use in the iX. The main focus of the Neue Klasse platform is to lower production emissions. Just recently announced that the NK platform will use sustainably sourced steel from Swedish company that doesn&#39;t use fossil fuels. 95%  reduction of CO2 emissions compared to the normal process.

My business work truck gets about 15mpg. Can\u2019t wait to electrify and decrease all that emissions.<\/p>\n\n<p>We also went from a Dodge Grand Caravan that got about 19mpg to a Nissan Leaf. The Leaf is awesome, but we would love something bigger.. just nobody makes anything, non-luxury.<\/p>\n<\/div>","58":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Google is your friend if you\u2019re really curious.

So if you want to buy a car now BMW is a decent choice. And it&#39;s 8 years since the i3 was released. The i division team left mostly in 2015. It&#39;s just BMW now, the i division is no longer a thing and performance EVs will be under the M division. Their current cars were made with NCM 811 battery chemistry in mind (lower costs) and production for that chemistry only started in mid 2020 in China. The i4 prototype was first spied testing in 2018. In late 2020 CATL had problems with NCM 811 battery fires and had to fix the problem so a good thing that BMW waited.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/pushevs.com\/2020\/09\/28\/catl-ncm-811-battery-cells-are-problematic\/\">https:\/\/pushevs.com\/2020\/09\/28\/catl-ncm-811-battery-cells-are-problematic\/<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>But the reason why the i4 is coming out now is because they waited for the end of life of the old 4 Series Gran Coupe (7 years). Couldn&#39;t produce the old F36 4 Series and make the i4 at the same factory on the same production line. That doesn&#39;t make sense.<\/p>\n\n<p>The i7 is coming out in 2022 because the current 7 Series is reaching end of life.<\/p>\n<\/div>","69":"<div class=\"md\"><p>It will be slower for those regions, definitely, but it won&#39;t take a 100 years for Asia or South America to transition.<\/p>\n\n<p>Do you know how long is a century??
