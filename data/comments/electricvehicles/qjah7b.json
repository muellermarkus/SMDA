The Model X has a fully adult-size third row. (Yes, really. And if you don&#39;t think so, then no three-row vehicle will satisfy you short of a Suburban - or else you&#39;re always hauling NBA players.)<\/p>\n\n<p>The Rivian R1S is coming soon, as is the Bollinger B1, Mercedes EQB, and VW ID.6.  Later are the Lucid Gravity and <em>MAYBE<\/em> Nissan or Mercedes-Benz electric minivans. (I actually doubt either of those will come to the US, though.)<\/p>\n\n<p>If you go for a plug-in hybrid, there&#39;s the Chrysler Pacific PHEV (yes, more of a mini-van) or Volvo XC-90 Recharge.<\/p>\n<\/div>","2":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Pacifica plug in hybrid is the only option you have.<\/p>\n<\/div>","3":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Does Sorento work? Not sure how the 3rd row space is, but it seems a viable enough PHEV.<\/p>\n<\/div>","4":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Can order right now, delivery in a while: Rivian R1SComing soon: Volvo XC90 (by end 2022 supposedly)<\/p>\n\n<p>AFAIK that&#39;s it for BEVs aside from the Model X and even smaller Model Y (which I barely think qualifies as a proper 3 row vehicle)<\/p>\n\n<p>Else, if including PHEV there&#39;s the Chrysler Pacifica, Volvo XC90, and a bunch of others.<\/p>\n<\/div>","5":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>We need 7 actual seats, not like the Model X where you\u2019d need to be a toddler to fit in the back seat<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><em>eyeroll<\/em><\/p>\n<\/div>","6":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Xc90 is pretty comfortable in the rear seat and any orders now should get the larger battery.  I fit on the back seat with a 6 seater and I&#39;m over 6 foot.  I wouldn&#39;t want to do a long road trip back there, but an hour or two is ok.<\/p>\n<\/div>","7":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Wait a couple of months for the NIO ES8. It\u2019s delivered in Europe with 6 or 7 seats, and a tow-hook.<\/p>\n<\/div>","8":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Audi Q7 hybrid might fit your needs.<\/p>\n<\/div>","9":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Is Canoo even close to reality?<\/p>\n<\/div>","10":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;ve read the ID.6 isn&#39;t coming to the US as of now. But we may get an ID.8 in 2 or so years.<\/p>\n<\/div>","11":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Third row isn&#39;t great for long trips for an adult. And it&#39;s really only 6 seats, not 7.<\/p>\n<\/div>","12":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Legitimately not a troll. Everyone said to do a Tesla for a 7 seat electric. We looked at it and saw that our car seat wouldn\u2019t even fit in the back (depth issue) with an adult sitting in the middle row. We need 7 useable seats and the model X\u2019s third row is tiny af. Even the worker at the Tesla store said that it wasn\u2019t meant to be an everyday 7 seater.<\/p>\n<\/div>","13":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Yeah, the word on the ID.6 seems to change constantly.<\/p>\n<\/div>","14":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Ignore that poster. They&#39;re our resident cringe edgelord. <\/p>\n\n<p>The X 3rd row doesn&#39;t fit a rear facing seat without major comprise in the 2nd row seating space. Can work in a pinch but won&#39;t work on road trips.  The falcon doors don&#39;t help because you can&#39;t really put a roof box on there if you want to drive longer distances or do a road trip.  A forward facing seat in the 3rd row is a touch better, but will still suffer with the kids legroom. It&#39;s better in the 2nd row.  <\/p>\n\n<p>My next door neighbor has an x, but typically uses their Mercedes GL for longer road trips or trips that require seating for more people. It&#39;s honestly shocking how small the model x is in luggage space with a third row down, in third row, leg room and headroom, and in luggage space with the third row up .<\/p>\n<\/div>","15":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I mean what you are describing is a minivan or a suburban.  I\u2019m not even sure my brother in laws Kia Telluride fits that description and it\u2019s pretty big.<\/p>\n<\/div>","16":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I think you got the X and Y confused.  The X is the one with gull wing doors, but a functional 3rd row.  The showrooms likely don&#39;t have any new Model X because the initial deliveries of the refresh are starting now.<\/p>\n<\/div>","17":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Thanks.
