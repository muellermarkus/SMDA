The advantage of smaller batteries is that it&#39;s easier to get the heat out of the middle.  From a thermal perspective, these may not be that different than the modules other manufacturers are using.<\/p>\n<\/div>","2":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Shit article. While the cell will store more energy (because it&#39;s much bigger), that cell being much bigger means that the pack will store less energy, because you can&#39;t pack those big cells as tight as smaller ones. Plus those cells only go into test production in March 2022, meaning they won&#39;t come until 2023 if they even do (if test production comes up with issues). And it&#39;s not even a Tesla product, they will be sold to anybody that wants them.<\/p>\n<\/div>","3":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Alright, where can I get a shitload of AA\u2019s?  What?  Oh, it\u2019s for my car.<\/p>\n<\/div>","4":"<div class=\"md\"><p>They build a high Nickel chemistry in 4680, and plan to buy NMCA and LFP in 4680.<\/p>\n<\/div>","5":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Yes, currently they are building them.<\/p>\n<\/div>","6":"<div class=\"md\"><p>The reason I ask, is this, from the article:<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2018 Canoo said they chose the Panasonic batteries\u2014which will not be the Tesla-specific 4680 format\u2014for their proven reliability.\u2019<\/p>\n\n<p>To heck with Tesla, I want 4680\u2019s in my bubble truck and I\u2019m willing to shell out serious coin to get it.\n\ud83e\udd2c<\/p>\n<\/div>","7":"<div class=\"md\"><p>They are at kato road<\/p>\n<\/div>","8":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I think the tabless tech is what would make tesla\u2019s 4680\u2019s stand out from a regular 4680<\/p>\n<\/div>","9":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Tabless allows for much less heat generations during charging and discharging which means they don&#39;t need as much cooling.<\/p>\n<\/div>","10":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Since the whole edge of the foil is attached the outside can (tabless, or more accurately, the whole edge is cut up into tabs), the distance from the outside to the furthest part away is less than 80mm.<\/p>\n<\/div>","11":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Cooled on the top and bottom instead of a ribbon going around the sides.<\/p>\n<\/div>","12":"<div class=\"md\"><p>This is not really true at all. The higher energy density more than makes up for the miniscule amount of lost cell density at the edges of the pack. Bigger cell means more volume is used for battery stuff and less for the shell or &quot;can&quot; of the cell. Thus the higher energy density.<\/p>\n<\/div>","13":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Tesla currently buys their battery cells and assembles them into a battery pack in house.<\/p>\n<\/div>","14":"<div class=\"md\"><p>4680 confers a cost benefit more than a functionality benefit. As an end user, it shouldn&#39;t matter much whether your cells are cylindrical or prismatic, as long as you&#39;re happy with the end product.<\/p>\n<\/div>","15":"<div class=\"md\"><p>More accurately, the whole edge is attached to the outside can and can wick away heat much more effectively than the relatively small tab used in the 18650\u2019s and 2170\u2019s.<\/p>\n<\/div>","16":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Thats speculation. Some conflicting information on that.<\/p>\n<\/div>","17":"<div class=\"md\"><p>They are making their own DBE high nickel 4680 cells which are currently being stockpiled.<\/p>\n<\/div>","18":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Incorrect. The new 4680\u2019s will incorporate both DBE and tabless, which should help dramatically with c-rates as well as cost. Possibly major gains in longevity too.<\/p>\n\n<p>Plus, as a whole pack, it should have dramatically better specific energy which lowers the vehicle\u2019s mass.<\/p>\n<\/div>","19":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Actually it is well documented, but as you say there is some FUD floating around on it.

If you look at the pictures from Berlin, it looks like its not the case.

They have only asked suppliers to do something in that format once their own were very advanced. These batteries take years to be fully verified. <\/p>\n\n<p>The cells Tesla makes are fully validated and tested. They have a high-speed production line in Fremont California, they are still improving the speed of that line and validate the output consistently hits individual cell requirements.<\/p>\n<\/div>","27":"<div class=\"md\"><p>The cells themselves are not in the prototype stage. It takes years to validate a design. They are in testing to ramp up production speed of the line (internal name Roadrunner) and making sure that line hits the same thresholds of cell quality consistently. They have slower internal prototype line that puts out good cells in enough quality for all testing and validation.<\/p>\n\n<p>The nature of this process is that you produce a lot of cells as you attempt to scale the line and if those cells are good they are likely stockpiling them. What they are working on is getting the utilization and consistency of the line up.<\/p>\n\n<p>This will happen in parallel with Model Y at Austin most likely.<\/p>\n<\/div>","28":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I mean, it has been some pretty profitable kool-aid. I drank it 4 years ago and 15x&#39;ed my investment!<\/p>\n<\/div>","29":"<div class=\"md\"><p>You think they are throwing away the good cells they are making? They are still tweaking the production process for higher speed and better yield.<\/p>\n<\/div>","30":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Whatever the comparison to prismatic, it is still a functional benefit.<\/p>\n\n<p>Lots of people are on here because they are interested in the technology, so they care about what is in the cars.<\/p>\n\n<p>Maybe post some links on recent advances on prismatic that you think are comparable what tabless 4680 cells might bring.<\/p>\n<\/div>","31":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Link to pictures with 4680 cells from Berlin?<\/p>\n<\/div>","32":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Source?

And its very competitive and actually beats anything actually deployed in real mass market cars.<\/p>\n\n<p>Tesla will be the first to bring Silicon anodes that are not silicon oxide to market. They will be the first with a structural high-nickel Cell-to-Pack. In combination they will easily be far ahead of anybody on pack level density.<\/p>\n\n<p>The way the Tesla anode design works, they can increase the amount of silicon over-time. The first version uses conservative amount, like around 10% silicon (we don&#39;t know the details yet as nobody outside of Tesla has a cell yet). However the architecture is designed to handle much higher silicon loads.<\/p>\n\n<p>There is no question Tesla is already quailing the next version already and are likely in early testing of the version after that, and likely researching the version after that.<\/p>\n<\/div>","41":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I posted what I saw when I googled it.<\/p>\n<\/div>","42":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Who is &#39;they&#39;?
