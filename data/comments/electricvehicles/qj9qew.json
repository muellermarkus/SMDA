The mall parking complexes have several other Volta chargers scattered about in addition to where Tesla stores its test drive vehicles with destination chargers.<\/p>\n\n<p>It also might be worth a shot to contact Volta themselves.<\/p>\n<\/div>","1":"<div class=\"md\"><p>The electricity is paid for by the property owners. The actual install varies based on the deal with the EVSE provider - some will come install them for free with the property owner paying for electricity, some the property owner has to buy it and install it just like a homeowner would.<\/p>\n<\/div>","2":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I believe Volta usually owns them, unless there\u2019s a specific arrangement in this particular case. So I\u2019d contact Volta, likely through their app. <\/p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s also possible Wegmans could ask Volta to put in more, so it couldn\u2019t hurt to tell Wegmans too.<\/p>\n<\/div>","3":"<div class=\"md\"><p>When I have communicated with Volta, they have been very responsive. They appreciate your input.<\/p>\n<\/div>"},"comment_toplevel":{"0":1,"1":1,"2":1,"3":0},"comment_distinguished":{"0":null,"1":null,"2":null,"3":null},"comment_edited":{"0":false,"1":false,"2":false,"3":false},"comment_is_submitter":{"0":false,"1":false,"2":false,"3":false},"comment_score":{"0":7,"1":3,"2":3,"3":3},"comment_stickied":{"0":false,"1":false,"2":false,"3":false},"author_id":{"0":"5loq8xhw","1":"6zrqu","2":"3ej9g26r","3":"1yt5r0y4"},"author_name":{"0":"Initial-D-and-GuP","1":"charonpdx","2":"trsmith83","3":"deeleite"}}
