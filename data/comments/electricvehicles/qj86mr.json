Lucid went 458 miles vs. 357 for Model S Raven and 232 for Taycan Turbo S. Today I&#39;d expect Lucid to still win by a large margin while EQS and S battle for second.

But I personally prefer it.<\/p>\n\n<p>That all said, I feel like the new S plaid takes it too far and removes things like the stalks unnecessarily just to be fancy.  We all have our lines to draw I guess.<\/p>\n<\/div>","93":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Only technical things are controlled trough touchpad. Ventilation, radio and such are with buttons.

The fact that they also sold some cars with issues to actual customers is a bit different.<\/p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t know if Lucid did it (and don&#39;t really care) but if these cars are the first to roll off the line it&#39;s not impossible some\/all of them may have to be monitored in case something goes wrong after a bit of use.<\/p>\n\n<p>(Usually automakers will build, test and scrap hundreds or thousands of cars before selling them officially.
