I&#39;m 19 with a good part-time job. I have enough money saved up and a good steady paycheck. I&#39;ve enjoyed the small cars. I grew up driving small cars like the 2 series. But BMW cars from my personal experience and others have too many problems. I really don&#39;t need a 4 seat car, the only reason the Lexus is one of my choices is that it&#39;s reliable, somewhat small, and my mother has had Lexus for so many years so we can use the loyalty program. My parents are obviously leaning towards the Lexus because they don&#39;t know anything about the Mazda and don&#39;t like me driving a tiny car lol. the Mazda is cheaper for me, but if I buy the Mazda, my parents won&#39;t co-sign and I don&#39;t have a credit score. I also enjoyed cars like the Suzuki Jimny and jeep when I was really young till I realized how expensive and inefficient the jeeps are and how good Suzuki is (sadly they don&#39;t sell them in the US anymore).

My biggest complaint is (other than the headliner being ruined after only 6 years) is driving the car in traffic. I think it&#39;s due to the DSG, but it is very very jerky. Also, sometimes you can&#39;t really tell when the power is going to come on, especially when accelerating up a hill out of a stop sign, so there will be nothing then... bam power. Anyway this has me leaning away from a DSG setup as well as turbo 4s (which may not be as much of an issue as the transmission here). Currently, the Lexus seems to be the best fit (not as fast as the BMW, but more reliable and as nice or nicer in the interior). But I am open to hear other options. The ATS seems to have most of what I&#39;m wanting at a better price, but I think I&#39;d be happier with some of the other options.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>","53":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Test Drove a 2020 Elantra and bloody loved it.

I&#39;ve had the same car since 2012 when I turned 16, which was a 2010 used Volvo C30 that now has reached the point where repairs are worth more than the car itself. I&#39;m looking to either buy or lease (whichever is the most cost effective option) a car that can get me to and from work everyday while running any errands in between reliably. I&#39;ll need something that can handle snow or inclement weather since it&#39;s the Northeast (moving from Michigan though, so I&#39;m used to awful weather) but isn&#39;t a tank. I&#39;ve been considering driving for uber or lyft as a way of getting to know my surroundings while also earning a little extra money on the side. That being said, if a lease is the best\/most cost effective option in terms of bang for buck, I&#39;m happy to not drive for those companies and save the miles, so this isn&#39;t a must. <strong>Really just looking for something that isn&#39;t horrible to drive, gets decent mileage and can handle the winter.
