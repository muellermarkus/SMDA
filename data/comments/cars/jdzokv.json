I came from B9 A4, to M340i, and currently on a FK8 type R.  A4 was nice, then as my lease ends, I wanted something cooler so got the M340i. but then feels like it was too similar to an regular 3 series despite having great power. the interior is literally the same, not even having additional carbon fiber trim or different seats. I was not happy with paying extra $100 (compares to an A4) for it.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Later I jumped on manual hype train and got the civic type r. It looks so good in my eye even after half year of usage. However, I start to feel the road\/wind noise are too high for my taste, and i&#39;d prefer a more comfortable ride. I realized i&#39;m not as hard core sports car fun as I thought I&#39;d be, and It&#39;s be better for me to have a dedicated fun car for weekend once I can afford it.  <\/p>\n\n<p>right now I&#39;m looking to replace my type r in the upcoming year once COVID situation is under control. I&#39;m looking for a car that looks good inside and out in it&#39;s price range, preferably not as common on the road. Ride well, quiet on highway cruise speed and with ACC to handle stop and go traffic. On top of that, having nice exhaust sound\/V6 would be great as this could be my last ICE car considering the trend.   <\/p>\n\n<p>Cars I&#39;ve considered:  <\/p>\n\n<p>Upcoming:  <\/p>\n\n<p>2022 Stinger GT. Good looking exterior, alright interior, relatively cheap compares to other V6 options, current gen praised for being a great GT car. But no digital cluster, and interior quality could be subpar compares to other traditional luxury brand.   <\/p>\n\n<p>2022 CT4-V blackwing. rumored with 450HP, cool digital cluster and other leaked interior bits. But small center screen, exterior backend looks weird.   <\/p>\n\n<p>2022 Audi RS3. Great and unique 5 pot sound, fast in straight line, high tech interior feeling. But could have too much plastic judging from current S3 interior, and exterior somewhat conservative compares to other high performance model.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Available now:  <\/p>\n\n<p>CLA45. Great looking inside out. But sound not as good and feel bad having a 4 pot in this price range.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Audi S5. Great looking outside, OK interior mostly because of the central screen looks a bit after thought. Great trunk space being a hatch. But sound and accelaration not as good compares to other options in the price range, more depreciation as an in between trim.  <\/p>\n\n<p>2021 C43. Decent looking inside out, last model year before refresh. Great 6 pot sound. But lots of bad story regarding the overall quality for this car which is built in the US. such as rim, transmission issue etc. Jerky shifting and stiff ride.  <\/p>\n\n<p>logically stinger looks like the way to go. being 20-30% cheaper comparing to other options. On the other hand, I don&#39;t consider myself as someone who cares about the badge of the car, but somehow other cars in the list just feel more exciting to me. It could just be the fact that other in the list are more exclusive, unique though.
