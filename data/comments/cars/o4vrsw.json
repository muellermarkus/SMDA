I tried to be more &quot;responsible&quot; and went without a car for a bit due to the COVID shutdowns then bought a Lexus IS 350C in January. I regret that decision. It&#39;s a fine car, but not at all engaging or fun, even when I replaced all the bits with their F-Sport counterparts. So, I had the itch and had my sights set on a 911, but I&#39;ve recently accepted a job with a significant pay cut so a 911 is probably off the table given how crazy prices have gotten for 991.1s. <\/p>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s what I&#39;ve considered:<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>m240i<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Pros: It&#39;s a very similar car to the m235i, obviously. Newer B58 engine and some other bits like Carplay, but otherwise it&#39;s very much the same car I already had. It&#39;s also probably the cheapest option I&#39;m considering.<\/p>\n\n<p>Cons: Steering is not great (only gripe I had with the m235i), hard to lease as very few new ones exist<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>C63 AMG<\/strong> <\/p>\n\n<p>Pros: just about everything is better than the m240i - that v8 is a beast, the sound is a lot better, the interior is better, etc. DCT transmission. Could theoretically lease it, though the MSRP is so much higher than the m240i<\/p>\n\n<p>Cons: it&#39;s a decent amount larger, more expensive (almost double an m240i)<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>M4<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Pros: I can get it in green, only soft top option now that BMW killed off the 2 series verts, engaging, can lease <\/p>\n\n<p>Cons: dare I say it - the front. Ditched a DCT for a ZF8. Also on the bigger side<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>m440i<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Pros: can get it in green, cheaper than an M4, has pretty darn good performance<\/p>\n\n<p>Cons: again, the front. On the bigger side. Seems like a better value play than an M4 - but is it better than an m240i? Probably not.<\/p>\n\n<p>Leasing vs. buying has appeal to me as it reduces my initial cash outlay (going to be doing some major house projects) and I apparently have become a car hopper.<\/p>\n<\/div>","5":"<div class=\"md\"><p><strong>Location<\/strong>: Tucson<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Price<\/strong> <strong>Range<\/strong>: $0 - 8k<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Lease or Buy<\/strong>: Prefer buy but willing to lease<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>New or Used<\/strong>: Used<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Type of Vehicle<\/strong>: Just not an SUV<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Must haves<\/strong>: Hybrid would be nice but unrealistic in this price range.

I can also find some WRX&#39;s but almost all are fairly high mileage (110k+) and much older (2008 or older). FiST and FoST are rightttt at the high end of my budget, and getting rebuilt titles definitely puts them in the affordable range. <strong>More and more I&#39;m thinking I should aim for the low end of my budget so I can save more for inevitable repairs\/maintenance at this age\/mileage.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>I think a <strong>WRX<\/strong> would fit my PNW lifestyle better (lots of driving around dirt roads) but it seems like knowing their maintenance history and avoiding heavily modded WRX&#39;s would be critical. But I worry looking at such high mileage vehicles. Not that many moonroofs.<\/p>\n\n<p>Mostly the same story for the <strong>GTI<\/strong>: the mileage range means I need to do some digging into maintenance records (tensioner, timing chain, etc.). It&#39;s a more refined car, which I like while I&#39;m driving in the city, and my &#39;06 Mazda3 did absolutely fine on 99% of the logging roads, so I&#39;m fine taking a city car off-road.<\/p>\n\n<p>With <strong>Focus\/Fiesta ST<\/strong>: I can find a few rebuilt models with low-ish miles (60-80k) in my price range. Moonroofs are VERY rare, however. The lack of usable backseat in the Fiesta turns me off, but I loved test driving them.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Mazda3<\/strong>: I got my &#39;06 in 2013 for $9k with 50k miles. I can&#39;t find anything remotely close to that these days, especially with a 2.5L engine. I would also want this to be a manual.

I hate myself at this point for getting rid of it, but I made the best decision I could with the information I had available to me at the time.  Another Stinger would be at the top of my list for my next vehicle if not for two things: 1) they changed the features available on the different trim lines and now getting all the same options I had on mine (basically everything that wasn&#39;t limited to the GT2 trim) will make it cost like $8K more than I spent on the one I had before, and 2) I have since moved into a condo with a shared driveway and getting the Stinger in and out of my garage will be a challenge.  We have a Kia Sportage that&#39;s already a tight fit and it&#39;s 14&quot; shorter than the Stinger.<\/p>\n\n<p>I haven&#39;t yet driven any of the other cars I&#39;m considering, but it seems like the GTI would be the best of the rest of the list in terms of ride quality while still being fun.  I had looked into something like the Veloster, but I get the impression that it has a really stiff ride and I&#39;m not interested in that at this point.  I had a 2003 Impreza a long time ago that I liked a lot, but it was pretty utilitarian and I am after some creature comforts.  I am not sure how much Subaru has improved in that dept. since I last had one.<\/p>\n\n<p>Worth noting: the car I had before the Stinger was a 2011 Scion xB that I had for eight years and liked a lot.  If I were designing a perfect car for me, it would basically be everything I liked about the Stinger -- fun to drive, decent gas mileage, features and comfort out the wazoo -- put into a form factor similar to the xB -- compact but still very roomy, good ride height.<\/p>\n\n<p>Thank you in advance for any insights and\/or recommendations.<\/p>\n<\/div>","11":"<div class=\"md\"><p><strong>Location:<\/strong> DC area, USA<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Price range:<\/strong> $4,000-15,000<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Lease or Buy:<\/strong> buy<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>New or used:<\/strong> used<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Type of vehicle:<\/strong> sedan<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Must haves:<\/strong>  blind spot monitoring and trunk space would be nice<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Desired transmission:<\/strong> auto<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Intended use:<\/strong> weekends\/some road trips<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered:<\/strong> Mazda, early 2000s Toyota Avalon, Nissan mid-late 2000s Versa S<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Is this your 1st vehicle:<\/strong> yes<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you need a Warranty:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> probably if google can teach me<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> No<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Additional Notes:<\/strong> I don&#39;t know the first thing about cars, just got my license and my parent wants to take me to Carmax tomorrow.

Ideally I&#39;d want to have a car that is RWD, manual, and can fit a 12 racquet bag, my ball machine, and a hopper full of balls.  Obviously the Miata cannot do that.  I looked at the hot hatch range, but I keep thinking that if I go hot hatch then life will pass me by and I might miss out on getting a manual RWD car until 10+ years in the future when they&#39;re all old and out of production.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Best case scenario for me is if there is a RWD manual car with enough space for my tennis gear, is reliable, has short gears enough gears that I won&#39;t go to jail for revving out second gear, and is under $37,000 out the door.<\/p>\n<\/div>","13":"<div class=\"md\"><p>What are your opinions on the ford maverick.

I like option A but don\u2019t know how reasonable it actually is, but my partner has a lot of anxiety that has certainly not been helped by us being told we were \u201clucky to survive\u201d our last drive in the old car, so option B is probably more likely- I think it will come down to whether it\u2019s possible to get \u201csafe and reliable\u201d in the option A price range. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Further Additional Details:<\/strong> We are honestly both totally out of the loop on cars- what the reasonable options are, what things cost, and how\/where to look. \u201cFor dummies\u201d level advice is appreciated- I\u2019m not sure how old is too old (I\u2019ve never personally owned a car newer than late 90s, but our borrowed car was a 2010 and absolute junk so I suspect I need to adjust my perspective there) or how many miles is too many miles.<\/p>\n<\/div>","25":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: USA Eastern PA<\/p>\n\n<p>Price range: &lt;60k<\/p>\n\n<p>Lease or Buy: Buy<\/p>\n\n<p>New or used: preferably new but maybe used<\/p>\n\n<p>Type of vehicle: car\/sports car\/ hot hatch<\/p>\n\n<p>Must haves: AWD and manual would be nice but willing to consider otherwise<\/p>\n\n<p>Desired transmission: Manual if possible (why are there so few manuals!)<\/p>\n\n<p>Intended use: Weekend\/DD<\/p>\n\n<p>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: I have looked at the supra, m235, golf r, s3, STI, not sold on anything, just looking for more input and no required timeline as of yet.<\/p>\n\n<p>Is this your 1st vehicle: no<\/p>\n\n<p>Do you need a Warranty: preferred<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle: yes<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle: suspension, never done engine work<\/p>\n\n<p>Additional Notes: This will temporarily be our third car as my SO&#39;s car is getting old but we have an RDX for utility and no kids, just 2 dogs.

I\u2019m looking to buy a practical but athletic car that can get up to speed in a respectable amount of time and have a little fun in corners. My first car was a I4 Chevy equinox so pretty much anything will be better than it performance wise.  I\u2019m looking to buy a new car with a budget of around $8,000. At first I wanted to get a v6 accord around 120-130,000 miles then replace the timing belt but any good examples of a v6 accord are 150+ miles away from where I live.<\/p>\n\n<p>What I\u2019ve found are a few listings for the 2012 Hyundai Genesis right at 150,000 miles ranging from $6,000 to $7,000 with a v6. I\u2019m pretty off put by how cheap they are considering all the options they are equipped with, and the rather competent seeming engine. I tried to look up reliability and it seems to be pretty solid, not like they are terribly unreliable therefor justifying these low prices.<\/p>\n\n<p>So I\u2019m curious are there any red flags to look for when buying a used Hyundai Genesis? Should I even consider buying one?<\/p>\n<\/div>","27":"<div class=\"md\"><p>2022 Kia telluride SX prestige nightfall or 2022 Toyota Highlander Limited Hybrid.
