This is my #1 choice as it is reliable, uncommon, (somewhat) sporty, carries an (albeit slightly) up-market marquee, and features a black headliner (something I&#39;ve really come to love). I&#39;ve seen a few on the market at $17K for 16,000 miles, which seems to be a steal.<\/li>\n<li>2014+ Lexus IS. Handily fulfills the reliability requirement, but carry a healthy premium over the Acura in both cost and miles - most are over $21K for under 45,000 miles - and I&#39;m not sure if the differences between this and the TSX are worth $4-6K <em>and<\/em> 30K miles.<br\/><\/li>\n<li>2007+ Lexus LS460. A very luxurious, comfortable, and (hopefully) reliable highway cruiser has always appealed to me, and this one hits all the boxes. While I love the interior on the refreshed models (2012+), they are a little too high ($35K), so it would likely be the pre-refresh models (&#39;07-&#39;12).

Infiniti G-Series, perceived reliability, poor-experience from a friend who owns one, and don&#39;t care for the aesthetics (in or out). Cadillac CTS, reliability, poor interior quality (that GM plastic), and high-cost for the CTS-V variant. Other American offerings, quality and reliability concerns - particularly compared to the TSX or IS. VW Golf and Jetta, great cars, but they are a little more common than I&#39;d like.
