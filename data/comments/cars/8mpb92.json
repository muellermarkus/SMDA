I&#39;ve looked towards honda, toyota, and nissan because I&#39;ve heard they&#39;re cheaper to maintain, but I&#39;m open to other brands - I just remember how much parts were for my old Jetta and don&#39;t want to re-experience that. I&#39;ve read mixed reports on the cost of maintenance for ford, chevy, mazda, and kia\/hyundai, so I&#39;m not sure what to think about them. I would only prefer a small SUV due to the high clearance (really bad roads around here once you&#39;re off the highway). Hatchback variety is preferred because my dog is a baby and doesn&#39;t like jumping in through doors, but it&#39;s not a deal breaker by any stretch. <\/p>\n<\/div>","2":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: Australia<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Price range: (Minimum-Maximum in your local currency) $95,000 - $120,000<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Lease or Buy: Buy<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 New or used: Either<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Type of vehicle: Performance\/Cports Car<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Must haves: Sub 5 second 0-100, ability to upgrade (tuning etc)<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc):<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Intended use: Fun Daily Driver<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: Porsche Cayman 718, Audi TT RS, BMW M2, Audi S5<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Is this your 1st vehicle: No<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Do you need a Warranty: No<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle: No<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Major work on your own vehicle: No<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Additional Notes: Have recently sold my &#39;15 C63s AMG Estate and want something with as much personality, but smaller.<\/p>\n<\/div>","3":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: California <\/p>\n\n<p>Price range: Less than $11k<\/p>\n\n<p>Lease or Buy: buy<\/p>\n\n<p>New or Used: used <\/p>\n\n<p>Type of vehicle: sporty <\/p>\n\n<p>Must haves: fun to drive<\/p>\n\n<p>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc): either<\/p>\n\n<p>Intended use: Daily Driver. 2 days a week will have to deal with LA traffic.

It has been a reliable car for the last 5.5 years and it does everything I need. I do wish it had a bit more power, and maybe a little less road noise. I also kind of want a sportier, more interesting car. I&#39;m having a bit of an early life crisis. I&#39;m not sure if I should trade in my car for a sedan that is more interesting, or keep my Accord as a DD and get a pure sports car that is more of a toy. If I trade in, I&#39;m looking to spend less than $20k. If I get a second car, I&#39;m looking to spend less than $12k. I&#39;m in Upstate NY, so I may have to rent a garage for my second car. Along with insurance and registration, this seems like an expensive proposition that may be more hassle than it&#39;s worth.

The Japanese also have a much stronger reputation for quality over American brands. Even if Charger was as reliable as the 6, public perception favours the Mazda to have  better resale down the line.

She loves her Volt for the fuel economy, but needs more space as our kid&#39;s car seat doesn&#39;t fit very well at all in her vehicle.  I have an SUV already (Jeep Grand Cherokee). She&#39;s not a huge fan of wagons, but her primary concern now is getting a safe car, as she wants to make sure the kiddo is protected first and foremost. She&#39;s less concerned about the driving experience and wants something that&#39;s comfortable, reliable, and gets her from A to B.<\/p>\n<\/div>","75":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[gel\u00f6scht]<\/p>\n<\/div>","76":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location:Germany\nPrice range:20-25k \u20ac\nLease or Buy\nNew or Used\nType of vehicle: Sportscar or Coupe or Sportsedan\nMust haves: Modern Tech and good performance\nDesired transmission: Auto\nIntended use: Daily Driver and Funcar\n1st Car\nDo you need a Warranty:NO\nCan you do Minor work on your own vehicle: NO\nCan you do Major work on your own vehicle: NO\nAdditional Notes: I love Mercedes Benz<\/p>\n<\/div>","77":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Between these, what would you do and why?<\/p>\n\n<p>2015 Camry LE Hybrid, 39k miles, $17,000\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.heisertoyota.com\/used-Milwaukee-2015-Toyota-Camry+Hybrid-LE-4T1BD1FK4FU168197\">https:\/\/www.heisertoyota.com\/used-Milwaukee-2015-Toyota-Camry+Hybrid-LE-4T1BD1FK4FU168197<\/a>  <\/p>\n\n<p>2014 Camry LE Hybrid, 21k miles, $15,000\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.toyotaofbrookfield.com\/used\/Toyota\/2014-Toyota-Camry+Hybrid-922590f30a0e0ae73cb3c3c7efa78ec5.htm\">https:\/\/www.toyotaofbrookfield.com\/used\/Toyota\/2014-Toyota-Camry+Hybrid-922590f30a0e0ae73cb3c3c7efa78ec5.htm<\/a>  <\/p>\n\n<p>2015 vs 2014 comparison for reference<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/cars.usnews.com\/cars-trucks\/compare?trims=None_12769-370154_12444-365535\">https:\/\/cars.usnews.com\/cars-trucks\/compare?trims=None_12769-370154_12444-365535<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Location:<\/strong> Wisconsin, USA<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Price range:<\/strong> 14-18k USD<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Lease or Buy:<\/strong> Buy<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>New or used:<\/strong> Used<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Type of vehicle:<\/strong> Sedan<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Must haves:<\/strong> Hybrid<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc):<\/strong> Automatic<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Intended use:<\/strong> Daily Driver, Family Car, <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered:<\/strong> See above<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Is this your 1st vehicle:<\/strong> No<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you need a Warranty:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> Some, maybe.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> No<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Additional Notes:<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/div>","78":"<div class=\"md\"><p>\u2022 Location: (United States, Chicago, Illinois)\n\u2022 Price range: ($1,000-$5,000)\n\u2022 Lease or Buy: Buy \n\u2022 New or used: Used\n\u2022 Type of vehicle: Sedan, Truck, Really anything\n\u2022 Must haves: Reliable \n\u2022 Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc): Manual \n\u2022 Intended use: Weekend Car\/ Daily at times\n\u2022 Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: Honda Civic, Mazda Miata, Toyota Tacoma\n\u2022 Is this your 1st vehicle: No \n\u2022 Do you need a Warranty: No\n\u2022 Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle: I\u2019m a car enthusiast but not great mechanically.

The modifications I plan on doing first are coilovers, breaks, wheels, tires, exhaust, shortshifter, then last possibly some kind of engine swap that I can turbo.
