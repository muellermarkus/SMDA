I plan on abiding by SMOG and CARB regulations, so the engine and power it has is what it will stay with. I also have a small garage I want the car to fit in (188in). All of these things are leading me to think the Z4M coupe is a good car for me. I plan on financing the car through a credit union, because current conditions make getting a great loan comfortably easy for me, keeping my money free, rather than buying outright.

I have two large dogs and a pregnant wife (early stages though), and I want a safe and spacious vehicle with AWD. I&#39;m thinking about a lease because of the times (would rather put money in the stock market as much as we can and I might want a hybrid in a few years).<\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m in Canada by the way, and looking at lowest leather trims. The Pilot EX-L I can likely get for about $550 a month for 3 years, because I am related to a sales manager and can get invoice price. This would also be no stress buying. The Ascent Limited could be $600-$700 depending on how much I can negotiate off MSRP (Subaru don&#39;t usually offer good deals here). 20,000km\/year.<\/p>\n\n<p>I think my wife would like the Ascent a bit more because it feels smaller to drive to my understanding, and is a couple inches smaller. The interior is nicer in some ways, though not necessarily functionally better. Ascent looks more awkward to me on the outside. Ascent has more ground clearance but Honda the superior AWD torque vectoring.<\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m also open to other options. I do really like the Telluride but the lease rates suck and it&#39;s more expensive.<\/p>\n\n<p>Our other car will be a Honda Clarity Touring which I expect to pick up this coming week.

I know in other threads people love to hate on them, but I don&#39;t want answers from the TeslaMotors sub and I&#39;m led to believe that every car is bad.  That doesn&#39;t make sense to me because they have a consumer reports recommendation, which has to mean something.  I know there are owners in this sub, I just want an honest answer.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you&#39;re wondering why I&#39;m here, the mods thought that me asking this question as a post qualifies as &#39;what car should i buy&#39;, even though I&#39;m not buying the car and have no interest.<\/p>\n<\/div>","67":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Location:<\/strong> West Coast US  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Price range:<\/strong> $30-45k  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Lease or Buy:<\/strong> Buy  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>New or used:<\/strong> New  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Type of vehicle:<\/strong> SUV  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Must haves:<\/strong> None that I can think of, I&#39;m pretty low maintenance  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc):<\/strong> Automatic  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Intended use:<\/strong> Daily commute &amp; weekend national park getaways  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered:<\/strong> Hyundai Santa Fe  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Is this your 1st vehicle:<\/strong> No  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you need a Warranty:<\/strong> Yes  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> No  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> No  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Additional Notes:<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p>I currently own a compact sedan.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Recently rented a few SUVs for road trips, and I like the feel of them.
