I&#39;m looking for something that&#39;s cool, fun to drive, reliable, can occasionally take me out of town (the coast, Bay Area, Socal, etc.), and something I can put some money into working towards really making it my own. open to any and all suggestions and thanks a ton!<\/p>\n<\/div>","7":"<div class=\"md\"><p>\u2022 Location: Northeast USA<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Price range: up to 20K<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Lease or Buy: Buy<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 New or used: Used<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Type of vehicle: Sedan or Hatch<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Must haves: Fun to drive\/handles well, practical, not ugly. <\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc): Auto<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Intended use: Daily<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: Mazda 3, GTI, Jetta GLI<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Is this your 1st vehicle: No<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Do you need a Warranty: Preferred<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle: Yes<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Can you do Major work on your own vehicle: No\n \u2022 Additional Notes:\nCurrently drive a 2005 Saab 9-3 and it seems to be dying a slow death on me.

I prefer not to get a car that its on its last year of design and new design not out, again that is due to my plan to have this car for a long time (maybe 2 design iterations). <\/p>\n\n<p>Thanks!<\/p>\n<\/div>","28":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Location:<\/strong> UK  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Price range:<\/strong>40k to 50k GBP  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Lease or Buy: Buy<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>New or used: Used<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Type of vehicle:<\/strong> Sports  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Must haves:<\/strong> N\/A  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc): Manual<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Intended use:<\/strong> Daily Driver,  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: n\/a<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Is this your 1st vehicle: no<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you need a Warranty: no<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle:<\/strong>yes  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle: no<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p>Maserati or an Alfa 4C?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<\/div>","29":"<div class=\"md\"><p>&gt;<strong>Location:<\/strong> Philadelphia, USA<br\/>\n&gt;<br\/>\n&gt;<strong>Price range:<\/strong>  less then $2,000\n&gt;<br\/>\n&gt;<strong>Lease or Buy:<\/strong> Buy<br\/>\n&gt;<br\/>\n&gt;<strong>New or used:<\/strong> used\n&gt;<br\/>\n&gt;<strong>Type of vehicle:<\/strong> cheap commuter\n&gt;<br\/>\n&gt;<strong>Must haves:<\/strong> \n&gt;<br\/>\n&gt;<strong>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc):<\/strong> auto\n&gt;<br\/>\n&gt;<strong>Intended use:<\/strong> Cheap city commuter\/beater for my girlfriend\n&gt;<br\/>\n&gt;<strong>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered:<\/strong> early 2000s Ford taurus, Toyota Corolla, cavalier, Honda Accord, etc.\n&gt;<br\/>\n&gt;<strong>Is this your 1st vehicle:<\/strong> No\n&gt;<br\/>\n&gt;<strong>Do you need a Warranty:<\/strong> no\n&gt;<br\/>\n&gt;<strong>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> yes\n&gt;<br\/>\n&gt;<strong>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> yes but would rather not\n&gt;<br\/>\n&gt;<strong>Additional Notes:<\/strong> looking for a reliable city car for my girlfriend.

I currently have a 2006 wrangler rubicon with ~160,000 miles. She still runs great but obviously there will be some major issues in the not to distant future. My plan is to either buy a Prius prime (~24k after tax rebate) and keep the Jeep as fun\/work\/winter vehicle. My other option is to sell the Jeep privately and buy a CPO Tacoma. I\u2019ve run the calculations and the two scenarios will end up costing almost the exact same after gas savings, insurance, etc. I drove both vehicles and honestly really enjoyed how nicely the Prius drove. It\u2019s got a lot of cool tech and I\u2019d be happy knowing I\u2019m helping out the environment a bit. On the other hand, Tacoma\u2019s are awesome. They hold their value very well and are super reliable. The best part would be having less shit to take care of. Using my jeep (which I love to death and really thought I\u2019d keep forever) in the winter requires a hard top, soft top for summer, and a trailer for utility purposes. It\u2019s a lot of extra shit to take care of. What are your thoughts?<\/p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m eyeing up a CPO 2016-17 Tacoma with long bed and V6.

While I don\u2019t require a truck for work, I do own investment properties that I rehab on occasion (thus the trailer for the Jeep). I haven\u2019t done a rehab in years but I\u2019d like to be able to in the future.

Its only main points of repair have been: outer tie rods, alternator\/battery decided to blow up (replaced w\/ refurbish), and AC finally decided to need a recharge this year. Otherwise no other issues (regular recommended maintenance has been kept).<\/p>\n\n<p>My wife has a 2017 Toyota Rav 4 LE, leased, that is due NEXT November (<strong>2019<\/strong>). Its been pretty good to us, though the windshield decided to shatter and we had to replace it with an aftermarket due to reasons.<\/p>\n\n<p>Next year is a bit of a toss-up. I&#39;m not sure where we will end up, but we know a few things so I decided to reach out and get some help from the people of reddit (crazy, I know.)<\/p>\n\n<p>1) We will be returning the 2017 Rav 4 LE. Its a good car, but we realized that if we were to own it, we&#39;d want to go up a level to an XLE. That and heated seats are going to be needed. Mainly because as much as we love the car, we need a <em>bit<\/em> more comfort if were going to keep it until the wheel fall off. See #2.<\/p>\n\n<p>2) The Suzuki will continue until it dies. I&#39;m not sure when that will be, but it&#39;s been good to me until the last year or so. Guess this happens after so many years of ownership. It&#39;s no longer quite as spritely, but does the job well.<\/p>\n\n<p>3) Wherever we end up, we will likely need to have at least one mid-size SUV-type car (i.e. HRV\/Crosstrek is not the answer. CRV\/Rav4 is, etc). This is due to a few reasons: Groceries, moving things, potential child sometime in the future, etc.<\/p>\n\n<p>The dilemma is that I&#39;m not sure if its worth it to wait until things settle down and live with the SX4 (with its much lower trunk space), or if we should look into getting a better optioned vehicle once we finish the lease.

First time posting on reddit. I am planning on buying a used car at the end of the year in the $10,000 to $12,000 range.

The one thing I don&#39;t know, and this is where you guys come in, is which cars to lean towards or steer clear from when it comes to insurance premiums. For example, I hear Honda Civics have higher insurance because they are one of the most stolen vehicles. I am looking for probably a Honda or Toyota (but doesn&#39;t have to be those two). Any advice on what cars would have lower insurance premiums? <\/p>\n<\/div>","118":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: USA , NYC<\/p>\n\n<p>Price range: 5k-25k<\/p>\n\n<p>Lease or Buy: buy<\/p>\n\n<p>New or used: either<\/p>\n\n<p>Type of vehicle: SUV<\/p>\n\n<p>Must haves: must have AWD\/ push to start ( is this safe, heard something about people hacking it?)<\/p>\n\n<p>Desired transmission (auto):<\/p>\n\n<p>Intended use: weekend car<\/p>\n\n<p>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: mazda , nissan <\/p>\n\n<p>Is this your 1st vehicle: yes<\/p>\n\n<p>Do you need a Warranty: IDK<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle: nothing ( but if there&#39;s a &quot;easy&quot; car to work with, I won&#39;t mind tinker with it)<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle: no<\/p>\n\n<p>Additional Notes:   <\/p>\n<\/div>","119":"<div class=\"md\"><p>So I already pretty much know what car I&#39;m getting: 2019 Hyundai Veloster 2.0 Premium, Automatic transmission.

I know that proper tires can make a difference but for example my mom drives a Dodge Caliber. Driving that car in winter is horrible. The back end swings all over the place, you have no control... will I have to weigh the Veloster down with cat litter boxes?<\/li>\n<li>Hyundai longevity - I&#39;m nervous about any new car purchase as this will be my first NEW car, and I understand the 2019 is a revamp. How does Hyundai hold up? I&#39;d like to have my next car for 10 years at least. Can I expect that from a Hyundai if I do the proper maintenance?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance. If anyone has any other information about the Veloster or Hyundai I&#39;ll happily take it!

When I get to Toronto I&#39;m going to buy one of these 3 cars. As soon as an opportunity opens up I&#39;m going to move back to Vancouver and sell which ever one I buy and get another V8 Pony Car. <\/p>\n\n<p>Now the thing is, the Mustang I currently take to the strip, car meets, and auto cross and it does great. Really reliable, performs great, great Mustang Community, meet a bunch of people and get tons of compliments.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now the Infiniti I feel will be the same in the auto community in terms of aftermarket, forums, and compliments. Not to mention its RWD, comes in a coupe, makes a great sound, cheaper on average, and has a great aftermarket. I feel like it&#39;ll be similar to my Mustang just slower.<\/p>\n\n<p>The Acura TL however has a much nicer interior and exterior (IMO), and from what I&#39;m seeing decently quicker in a straight line. I also have a lot more experience working on Hondas than I do Nissans. But I don&#39;t like the FWD V6, I feel like it&#39;ll be front heavy. <\/p>\n\n<p>The Civic Si I won&#39;t have to run around looking for a manual as it only comes in stick. It&#39;ll handle better than the Acura around whatever auto-cross track there is, get better fuel economy than both, be cheaper on maintenance as its smaller, and be just as reliable. Downside is that its difficult to find a 4-door version, and significantly slower in a straight line. It won&#39;t be nearly as fun at the 1\/4 mile compared to the others.  <\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve driven all 3, the Acura and the Infiniti don&#39;t feel as exciting as my Mustang. The 8000RPM Redline on the K20Z3 makes the Civic Si Feel great. I also think it&#39;ll handle a little better than the G35 but probably wont&#39; be as quick due to the power difference. <\/p>\n\n<p>All 3 I&#39;m looking at under $10k, and around 150-170k km. The Acuras are higher priced compared to the others, better interiors, better exterior, and are slightly quicker in a straight line.
