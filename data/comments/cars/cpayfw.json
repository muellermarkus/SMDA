Now I may more or less adopt an older sports car which changes some qualities needed in my dd. That is that it won&#39;t need to be as sporty and I can lean towards reliability and effecienct. Is there a good dd that can can glide over the bumps and cracks of Maine roads while pulling off 30+ mpg and have some sense of luxury qualities? Nice seats and tactile feedback of the buttons?

I can insure a C6 (2005, 2007 for 180\/167 a month respectively, and a C7 (2014) for 212. Being 19, these are definitely going to go down when I&#39;m 20\/21, and I would plan to buy one of these at that age.
