I grew up around classic cars from the company Intermeccanica. My first car was a Saab 9-3 Viggen. My second, which I had until very recently, was a 1967 right-hand drive MGB GT. I&#39;ve owned a VW Westfalia Vanagon camper. I currently have a Fiat 500 Abarth which I purchased because of its great gas mileage and the smile it puts on my face when I start it up for my morning commute. I like weird cars.<\/p>\n\n<p>What are some of the weirdest, most charming cars that have the most character. There are a lot of cars that are phenomenal on paper but have no soul, like anything sold by Acura. Then there are cars like the 500 Abarth that have just enough performance to be interesting and have personality in spades.<\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m in stage one of beginning to shop for a new hobby car. All limitations are off. I just want something that gives me pride to own the way my MG did and my Abarth does. Are there any SUVs you can think of that have personality? How about sleeper cars, like the E63 AMG\/R63 AMG but affordable to normal people?<\/p>\n\n<p>tl:dr - What are some cars you&#39;ve owned or experienced that made great talking points, raised eyebrows, and generally left you with a smile on your face?

I&#39;m currently a college student getting some money coming in and was looking for the best option for me, and I&#39;ve narrowed it down to two.<\/p>\n\n<p>My budget is pushing it at $4k. I was thinking of getting a 2008 Mazda 3, but my friends family is selling a &#39;85 Mercedes 190e for only $1000. I learned to drive in the same car and love it to death, and I heard they aren&#39;t terrible to work on. Car is in good condition, new water pump and filters. Heard that it drives great still but I&#39;m gonna go check it out soon.<\/p>\n\n<p>Should I shell out and buy the Mazda or grab the 190e at its price? Hard choice because I love the look of the 190e but the Mazda gets better gas mileage, but I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s worth the $3000 extra. Help please! <\/p>\n<\/div>","73":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[entfernt]<\/p>\n<\/div>","74":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[gel\u00f6scht]<\/p>\n<\/div>","75":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: Maryland<\/p>\n\n<p>Price range: N\/A (cash sale, when Mom&#39;s estate settles in 2018)<\/p>\n\n<p>New or Used: Used (2-3 years old maximum)<\/p>\n\n<p>Type: Crossover or small SUV, 4WD<\/p>\n\n<p>Transmission: Auto<\/p>\n\n<p>Intended Use: 26 y.o. daughter and her new husband want to travel across the US, and currently drives a 2000 Camry with 200K+ mies and body damage.

I currently have a 2007 Toyota Rav4 and am not looking to put any additional money into it in order to pass inspection because it keeps getting more expensive and the car is at 196k miles.<\/p>\n\n<p>I am in a position financially to get something on my own. I basically keep going back and forth though because I love smaller sporty cars and crossovers like FiST, FocusST, and CX-3 that have nice body styles. I really like the CX-3 because it is automatic, within my price range for a 2016\/17 Grand Touring model, and has a body style that I is visually appealing to me. I do not need something that is performance based as I am a more casual driver, but the CX-3 seems to still be a nice\/fun drive. <\/p>\n\n<p>My concern comes in with space, I have been so used to having the trunk space of my Rav-4 and it&#39;s really convenient to throw skis, golf clubs, luggage, beer coolers into my trunk or my kayak on the roof while also being able to fit friends in the back seat if necessary. It seems like realistically though, to get a car of this size within my budget I would be looking at a baseline 2015\/16 model. <\/p>\n\n<p>At the end of the day, I&#39;m trying to rationalize how often I really would have people in my backseat and how often I would really need to be taking with me. I know with the CX-3 I would be able to get roof rack\/storage for skis and kayak, but feel like I could get away with a mixture of golf clubs, luggage, and a cooler in the backseats with both or the 60 side folded down. Plus a passenger in the back who knew they would be cramped. One of my best friends has a FiST and has made our mountain trip with 2 passengers and the rest of his car packed to the max. Or I could look into something like an HR-V, that appeals to me less for it&#39;s visual exterior and interior style, but would give me more space. <\/p>\n<\/div>","78":"<div class=\"md\"><p>So my mom has a Nissan Altima for work and after I think 70 or 80 thousand miles she gets a new car and they offer the current car to buy for what the dealer is willing to pay for if u wanted to keep it and own it and my mom said preveious cars she got offered from her work were good prices its prob a 2014 or 15 idk I dont imagine any older.
