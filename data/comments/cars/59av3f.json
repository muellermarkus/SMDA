So I recently moved from Hawaii to Nevada (Henderson) and my car is still in Hawaii. I&#39;m thinking of leaving it there for my younger sibling(s) to use when they can drive in a few months and buying myself something new here.  <\/p>\n\n<p>If I do get a new car, it&#39;d be something along the lines of a fun sporty car with daily functionality. Ideally I&#39;d want automatic since I never learned to drive stick (please don&#39;t hate me) but I&#39;m open to the prospect of learning maybe.<\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not really sure what my price range is.

Again, I&#39;m new to buying a car (my parents got me my first car and I&#39;m driving an old Tacoma from my cousin right now) so I really have no clue what I&#39;m doing  <\/p>\n\n<p>edit: also looked at stuff like the 370z and Lexus RC cars, not sure about those either <\/p>\n<\/div>","1":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: Northern BC Canada<\/p>\n\n<p>Price range: lease up to 600\/mo or purchase of 25k<\/p>\n\n<p>New or used: New or used<\/p>\n\n<p>Type of vehicle: Wagon\/hatchback<\/p>\n\n<p>Must haves: At least somewhat fun.

I don&#39;t plan to track the car any time soon, but I&#39;d like to keep that option open. I&#39;m primarily looking at used cars, around the $20k mark or less preferably.<\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m waiting until around Spring before I buy something, but I&#39;ve started to put together a list of cars. The problem is, this list is continuing to grow because I keep finding cars I hadn&#39;t considered before. I started off with looking at BRZ\/FRS and Miata, but now I&#39;ve started looking at early Boxsters and 911s in addition to a bunch of other things.<\/p>\n\n<p>So far the list contains:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>FRS\/BRZ<\/li>\n<li>Miata<\/li>\n<li>Boxster\/Boxster S<\/li>\n<li>911<\/li>\n<li>MR2<\/li>\n<li>S2000<\/li>\n<li>Fiat 124 <\/li>\n<li>Supra<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Out of the above, I&#39;ve driven a BRZ, Miata NB and ND, and recently a 2003 911. Each of them have their own flavor and I liked them all. <\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;d be happy to drive all of them as a weekend car. <\/p>\n\n<p>For a project car, Miata is probably going to be the best bet due to relatively cheap parts and high availability, in addition to the huge community. But stylistically I like the other cars over the Miatas. The 124 does have the looks, but it&#39;s a pretty new car and doesn&#39;t seem to have quite the aftermarket support just yet. <\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;d love to get a Porsche but parts looks to be more expensive than any of the other cars on the list. And seems to be a pain to work on. I am aware of the IMS issues with the early Boxsters and aware of the cost of getting that replaced. <\/p>\n\n<p>The S2000 appears to be gaining on popularity, so that may be a good buy especially before they get too expensive. Still have to drive one. I haven&#39;t had the chance to look at the aftermarket\/community support for this.<\/p>\n\n<p>Anyway, my question is, what cars should I consider eliminating from the list above? What should I prioritize either because they are getting rarer or increasing in price?<\/p>\n<\/div>","5":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location southern wisconsin\nPrice range 30k but could go a bit more \nSports car\nWould prefer a American car but doesn&#39;t have to be\nIntended use as a weekend car\nVehicles I consider late 90s viper, corvette, dodge charger\/challenger srt8. \nNot my first vehicle\nDoes not need a warranty\nI can do both minor and major work\nI am just looking for a fun fast sports car for the summer and weekends.<\/p>\n<\/div>","6":"<div class=\"md\"><ul>\n<li><p>Location: North East US..<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Price range: $15-20k<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>New or used: Used<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Type of vehicle: SUV, maybe sedan<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Must haves: AWD, Reliability, Cheap Maintenance, Fuel efficient, Cargo Space, <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Intended use: Daily Driver<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered:  RAV4, CRV, maybe Corolla S<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Is this your 1st vehicle: No <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Does the vehicle need to have a warranty: Would be a plus<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle: Potentially<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle: No<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Additional Notes: This will be my girlfriend&#39;s daily commuter.

I eyed the GTI out initially because from what I&#39;ve heard everything just makes <em>sense<\/em> in the interior. Something that drives me absolutely insane is poor design choices in little things. A button slightly out of comfortable reach, cupholders a mm too small, just small seemingly insignificant things. I guess the part of me that loves fixing things like that just gets to me too much, so I&#39;d like a car that has really nice attention to detail. I&#39;ve heard the WRX is somewhat of the opposite. The engine is better, easier to work on, and more open to mods. However, I&#39;ve heard the interior has some things to be desired, and from what I&#39;ve seen there isn&#39;t much tech in it. Also, I&#39;ve seen a few statistics saying that WRXs are more likely to be pulled over. Being someone who drives pretty quick normally, I don&#39;t want to stick out too much. My mitsubishi is perfect for that, but goddamn it&#39;s slow. The audis I initially started looking at because the engine is the same\/very similar between the GTI and the A3. I initially counted out the sedan as I wanted a long trunk to put folding tables and guitars, but when I checked one out at the dealership I saw that the seats folded down, giving it a ton of space. Pretty close to the hatchback, but not as much vertical clearance. I drive down to Mexico a fair amount, and being able to fit a cooler, some bags, and some groceries is nice. <\/p>\n\n<p>The newer tech I really enjoy includes things like lane assist, adaptive cruise control, blind spot monitoring, automatic braking if I approach a car too quick, parking sensors, and android integration. While all this is something I really enjoy, I know it may be out of my price range. <\/p>\n<\/div>","13":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[gel\u00f6scht]<\/p>\n<\/div>","14":"<div class=\"md\"><p>\u2022 Location: Currently in Southeast Virginia with the potential to relocate to Lancaster, PA and various other locations ranging from Florida to New Hampshire (job has me rotating a lot)<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Price range: $18,000-$28,000 USD<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 New or used: Either<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Type of vehicle: Truck, Hatchback or Sedan<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Must haves: FWD or AWD, 4 or 6 Cylinder, Nice Interior, Decent on Maintenance, Reliable, Fun<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Intended use: Primarily as a daily driver.

The new civic hatchback looks great as well, but I understand that this isn&#39;t performance oriented. I&#39;ve driven a GTI and I love it, but VW has left a bad taste in my mouth in terms of what I&#39;ve read about the Mexican made vehicles and the emissions scandal. In short, there is no perfect car for me, and I&#39;m going to have to make a compromise.

Fortunately it is paid off.<\/p>\n\n<p>She needs to have a car there for when she is in town and renting and zip car wouldn&#39;t work.  I&#39;ve tried to suggest ditching the Camry and getting another used sedan\/hatchback of that era or earlier and getting something that won&#39;t be affected as much by sitting without use for months at a time and something that is much simpler to maintain and fix when it does ultimately break down.

I am searching for a car to drive on a daily base, taking 3 others with me (which is why I need 4 seats). As I am traveling about 100km (~62miles) a day it should be quite reliable. As fuel is quite expensive in germany my consumption shoud not be too high either. Now comes the tricky part: I want a car that does not look like every other car out there. I want something catchy, something people will look at because they dont see it on a daily base. I also really like the old edgy design so I thought about a Chevrolet Camaro V6 or Ford Mustang V5, but they are out of my reach in terms of consumption and money (mostly money). As stated above I already looked at the Hyundai Veloster and Toyota GT68. Problem ist, the GT only has 2+2 seats, which makes sitting in the back really uncomfortable, so I&#39;am stuck with the Veloster as my only choice. I honestly like the Veloster, but as there are not al lot of them (at least one the german market), there are not many choices of which I could pick one out that satisfies me completely. So does anyone know a car I overlooked on my desperate search?<\/p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance.<\/p>\n<\/div>","83":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Don&#39;t know if im in the right thread, but has anyone had past experiences with the Lexus IS300 2jz?

As noted above, safety features on the SUV would be great. Not sure on the specificity of the safety feature since I am not very knowledgeable on the subject cars. Although I just had an accident in which totaled my car ( random tire was flying on the way and totaled my car). Hence I need a possible safest SUV available within reach. It would be great if the said SUV recommendation is aesthetic but I value safety more than anything.

I live in the middle of some of the best technical mountain roads in the United States and want a car that performs as well as my motorcycle in the twisties and the track.  I do plan on several major upgrades to whatever vehicle I buy, specifically power adders to at least 500 hp at the wheels and a sequential transmission.  Many of our roads are very nice and well groomed, but some can be quite rough, so the car needs to be able to be set up to handle some choppy asphalt on occasion.  <\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve always had my heart set on a R34 Skyline GTR, but the prices of good condition cars seem to be rising and may be out of my budget by the time they are importable to the US.  The R33 are cheaper by a good bit right now and I do like they way they look.  Performance is my main goal, though good looks is a close second.  I want to feel pride in the car and enjoy sharing it with others.  Are there any other cars that are both good looking and handle like a laser beam on rails?<\/p>\n<\/div>","99":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Been getting a lot of that.
