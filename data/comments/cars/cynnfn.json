I wanted a GTI then, still do but have also been looking at the Civic Sport hatch with the 6 speed manual. I wish I could get a Civic Si in a hatch but since I can&#39;t and don&#39;t want to stretch to 35K for the Type-R, do you think a Civic Sport 6MT with a manual and Hondata tune would be a better bet than a 16+ GTI with PP or Sport?

I&#39;m curious if those who have experience with higher mile BMW might be able to chime in.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Good<\/strong>: 2010 BMW 335i sedan, sport package, premium package, 6-spd auto. Green in color with beautiful caramel brown leather. 126k miles, never lived in the north, runs and drives really well. I actually went to the test drive very skeptical and expecting to be discouraged from buying it, but it felt very solid, straight, and really quite impressed me. It has new tires and new brakes. He will let it go for only $6k, which is pretty great price compared to what I&#39;ve seen. The interior is in really great condition which is a major point for me.<\/p>\n\n<p>According to the owner, the common failure point of the HPFP was replaced, and the injectors, coils, plugs, have all been replaced. Since he has owned it (45-126k miles) he has not had the common turbo work done. So either it was not affected by the wastegate issues or the first owner had it fixed already. It&#39;s not mentioned in the carfax. He said it was a very reliable car for him.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Downsides<\/strong>: The guy did not keep his damn service records, despite obviously taking care of it. I only have a couple dealer records he was able to pull from the local dealer, carfax records, and his word to go buy. Also, he is literally leaving town tomorrow and does not have the time to have a PPI done, which I really wanted to do. He basically said he is taking it to Carmax by tomorrow if everything falls through with the folks looking at it.<\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m coming from a 2016 wrx which has been perfectly reliable, which I plan to trade in for a larger familiy vehicle for my wife. The bmw will be my daily commuter. I can do basic and medium-level maintenance but don&#39;t have the time or space to do very intensive work.<\/p>\n\n<p>For the price and the known factors, how cautious would you be to take the risk of the high mile german car? I looked at another 2011 model with 106k miles with worse interior condition and smelled of smoke. It was selling for 10.5k (at a dealer).

I don&#39;t really have a grasp of how things work. My dad used to work for a gm dealership as one of the managers. So anytime somebody in the family needed a car, he would hook us up really good.<\/p>\n\n<p>For example. My first car was a 99 pontiac grand am. A lady got it towed there after it had a small fire, and she wanted to trade it in for a new car. She wanted nothing to do with it. Since I needed a car, my dad told her he&#39;d give her 500 bucks cash for it. Under the table deal. Didn&#39;t involve the dealership. So she did that, my dad spent like 200 bucks fixing the issue and a bit more doing some other work on it. And gave it to me. Was a great car for several years. But eventually it had some really bad issues and leaks. Expensive ones to fix. and the bottom was rusting so so bad that my dad was convinced it wouldn&#39;t last another winter. So we sold it on Craigslist for 600 bucks. And he kept an eye open for another car for me.<\/p>\n\n<p>He eventually found a 2004 pontiac grand prix, with all the options. Perfect condition inside and out. Like 120k miles. Her husband passed away and she didn&#39;t need two vehicles anymore. She brought it in to trade in and get some work done on the other car. I bought it from her for 1500. More than she would have gotten, and way way less than they would have sold it for. Been driving that for like 4-5 years. Been super great. Problems are rare. AC keeps breaking, that&#39;s about it. The rest is just routine stuff. Fucking love this vehicle. Looks really good, the seats are so comfortable, I fucking love the steering wheel, the heads up display, the vehicle has a lot of power too, it&#39;s enjoyable to drive. It&#39;s a really damn good vehicle. My dad says it has a really good engine, and it&#39;s likely to last me well over 300k miles if I treat it right. <\/p>\n\n<p>But you can see how I&#39;ve been spoiled. Having somebody in the business has gotten me super cheap vehicles, and super cheap maintenance. Father no longer works there though. And now I want to buy another vehicle. I don&#39;t want to sell my grand prix. But I do want to get a standard transmission car to drive around. I haven&#39;t looked around very much at, but I like how the 2001-2005 toyota celica looks like(I don&#39;t even know if that car is even good). It also gets better fuel economy than my current vehicle. But they can be costly. I honestly expected to pay under $2000 for a car that maybe has some minor problems. And I could learn how to work on a car by using YouTube to fix it myself. I see these for like 3-4k or even more. And honestly, I think my 04 grand prix has way way way better interior and probably engine too? I really got some good deals when my dad was finding me cars.<\/p>\n\n<p>So I&#39;m just wondering what can I expect from buying a car myself that will be different than basically getting them from my dad&#39;s connections. Can I get a good car for 2k? What can I do with $2000? The grand prix I got is such a good car that I got for so cheap. So I just have no idea about what I can get for how much, or how much I might have to spend to get something decent. All I know is I want to get a standard transmission car that I like for cheap.<\/p>\n<\/div>","185":"<div class=\"md\"><p>2017 Dodge Challenger GT is all wheel drive but only available in automatic.
