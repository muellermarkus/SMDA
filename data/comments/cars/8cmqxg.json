Wife has a VW Atlas that can do the job, but we take turns doing daycare drop off so I want a car that can comfortably handle the job.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Location: USA, DC<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Price range: $25-40k<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Lease or Buy: buy<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 New or used: new<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Type of vehicle: sedan, maybe small suv<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Must haves: room for 3 carseats, comfortably- aka lots of rear seat legroom. Leather seating. Good audio system. Performance highly desired, would only consider the V6 legacy for example. <\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc): in the past, I have greatly preferred manual for being fun to drive, but I realize in this segment most of the options are cvt or auto.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Intended use: daily commute and drop off for kids at daycare<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: Subaru legacy<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Is this your 1st vehicle: no<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Do you need a Warranty: yes<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle: yes, but I don&#39;t want to<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Can you do Major work on your own vehicle: no<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Additional Notes: current vehicle is a Ford focus. Technically I can fit 3 car seats into the back of it but it&#39;s not comfortable at all and with a rear facing seat in the passenger side rear the front passenger seat is nearly unusable. I like driving small cars, but I realize I need to make a compromise here. Something like another Atlas would work but would be Overkill for what I need. A sedan with an extra 6 iches or so combined front and rear leg room compared to the focus would probably work great.<\/p>\n<\/div>","86":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: Perth, Australia <\/p>\n\n<p>Price range: 15-23k neg<\/p>\n\n<p>Lease or Buy: Buy<\/p>\n\n<p>New or used: Used<\/p>\n\n<p>Type of vehicle: Sporty hatch, occasional autocross toy and daily driver.

I know it&#39;ll almost certainly cost me a lot of money, and I&#39;m not doing anything until I have a bunch saved up, but I bought this car because my parents didn&#39;t approve of me buying any of the fun cars I really lusted at during college, and I really feel like I&#39;m starting to resent my decision now. I want to drive an &quot;enthusiast&#39;s car&quot; while I&#39;m young and mostly unattached, because I may move from Texas to Canada or some other, colder place in a few years, so I want to get good at RWD before I move somewhere way fucking colder than the place I&#39;ve lived my whole life. I know this is stupid, but life is too short to drive boring cars, and you have to pay to play, so sometime this year (probably about 6 months from now) I want to trade into some kind of economy performance car, preferably RWD, for absolutely no more than $22,000, and I&#39;ll lie to my parents about how much money I spent.
