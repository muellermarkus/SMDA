My question is, do you think a 17yr old car is too old to be reliable, despite the low mileage?

Good handling (Even though I don&#39;t live in an area with that many sharp sweeping corners to take.) Basically a 2 seater car considering no normal sized person could fit in the backseats. Still nice to &quot;technically&quot; have backseats for insurance rate purposes and some storage I guess.<\/p>\n\n<p>- Hyundai Genesis Coupe: Not really sure what to say about this one, it looks nice but the gas mileage isnt as good as the FRS.
