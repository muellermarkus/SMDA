So I&#39;ve been looking at BMWs on sale for about a week now, and I&#39;m not sure which ones to actually consider.<\/p>\n\n<p>So here&#39;s the ones I&#39;ve been looking at the most:<\/p>\n\n<p>-1998 E46 328i with 274k km\/170k mi<br\/>\n-2000 E46 323i with 250k km\/155k mi<br\/>\n-1991 E34 525i with 350k km\/220k mi<br\/>\n-1989 E34 520i with 325k km\/200k mi<br\/>\nAll of these are for sale for around the same price, 2200-2500\u20ac or around $2500-$2800<br\/>\nI did also think about a 2001 Opel Omega 2.6 with 286k km\/180k mi.<\/p>\n\n<p>The one I&#39;ve been thinking about the most is the 2000 323i since it has the lowest mileage of the 4 and looks the best, but I&#39;m tempted to go for the E34 because from what I understand meintenance is easier\/cheaper and since I test drove one I know what it&#39;s like and I loved it. Also considering the Omega since parts are cheaper and I&#39;ve test driven one.<\/p>\n\n<p>The problem is these are all pretty far away from me and from eachother, with the exception of the E34 and Omega which are in the same town (still 2.5h from me), so I don&#39;t really have the chance to test every one, so I have pretty much have to make my choice before going to see one.<\/p>\n<\/div>","8":"<div class=\"md\"><p>\u2022 Location: sw United states<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Price range:  $40,000 max<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Lease or Buy: buy<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 New or used: new<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Type of vehicle: sedan or crossover suv<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Must haves: fuel efficient, adaptive cruise control<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Desired transmission: any<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Intended use: daily driver<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: \nRav4 hybrid, tesla 3 standard, kia niro plug in <\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Is this your 1st vehicle: no<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Do you need a Warranty: yes<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle: yes <\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Can you do Major work on your own vehicle: no<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Additional Notes: commute is increasing to 60 miles each way and would like more autopilot-y functions, awd or 4x4 would be great.

As an explanatory note, I am hard of hearing so always want to see the name of the song and artist - while still using the Nav.<\/p>\n\n<p>Daughter is going to drive the CX-5.  I bought a 2017 BMW 340i xdrive in November 2019.  Loaded with everything.  <em>Plus:<\/em> very fast, good handling, loads of equipment, infotainment and heads up display.  <em>Minus:<\/em> offset pedals\/seat causes severe pain, low seating and entry, general lack of comfort, not quiet enough at highway speed.<\/p>\n\n<p>So I&#39;m 53 and I made a mistake.  Call it a mid-life crisis or a brain fart.  I still love sporty cars.  I had a 328 years ago.  Before I got the Mazda I almost got a Lexus GX460 or GS350. So a full frame SUV or sports sedan.  I tend to like cars that are more than just appliances.  I wish the new Bronco was out. Wrangler appeals but reliability (and JL steering issues) and NVH\/comfort concern me.  I find the Q5 boring.  I could live with it, but would be eager to switch again. So ultimately, something comfortable, practical but also a little bit fun.<\/p>\n<\/div>","38":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: Canada, QC<\/p>\n\n<p>Price range: 250$-350$ CAD monthly<\/p>\n\n<p>Lease of 5 years (unless the car is worth keep for much longer, then finance)<\/p>\n\n<p>New (unless once again its worth to buy an older but more equipped car for the same price)<\/p>\n\n<p>Type of vehicle: sedan<\/p>\n\n<p>Must haves: Automatic transmission, efficient heating (canada eh), fuel efficiency.<\/p>\n\n<p>Intended use: Student car.
