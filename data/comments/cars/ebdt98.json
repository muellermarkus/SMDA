We&#39;re getting $27K for it but I don&#39;t need to spend all of that. I loved my Odyssey because we could easily fit a third adult and all our camping gear plus the sliding doors made it easy to get the kids in and out but we only need a third adult two weekends a year and we only go camping once a year so it seems like a waste to drive 50 miles a day in that big a car. Plus, it hurt my little green heart to only get 20-21 mpg. I loved my Matrix and I had it for 12 years but you had to hold the doors open to get the kids in and out and I lost visibility when I had the double jogging stroller in the back.
