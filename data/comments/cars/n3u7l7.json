class=\"md\"><p>Is it a crazy idea to buy a Porsche Macan with the air-ride for a guy that spends 5-10% of his driving time on Forest Service Roads?  <\/p>\n\n<p>I am a huge car enthusiast. I&#39;d love something really fun to drive while still being able to pound up FSRs around British Columbia in the summer for mountain biking.  <\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;d get more agressive tires, smaller rims, and skid plates.  Thoughts? How stupid am I?<\/p>\n<\/div>","1":"<div class=\"md\"><p>So my wife and I have matching Ford Fiesta STs. Great fun little cars. But for some reason Carmax has offered my significantly more than I paid for them. So I&#39;m considering selling one of them to move to something a little more grown up and comfortable for my 6&#39;4&quot; chubby frame. Just hunting for some suggestions, because I keep talking myself out of things. <\/p>\n\n<p>Location: Southern California<\/p>\n\n<p>Price range: Complicated. I&#39;m open to a used purchase or a new lease. I want a payment of below $400, so that&#39;s about $15-$20k financing used, or on average $40k or so leased. <\/p>\n\n<p>Lease or Buy: Either<\/p>\n\n<p>New or used: Either<\/p>\n\n<p>Type of vehicle: Sedan, coupe<\/p>\n\n<p>Must haves: Prefer RWD, for variety&#39;s sake. Interior I fit in. Not going to bankrupt me to keep running. <\/p>\n\n<p>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc): Prefer manual<\/p>\n\n<p>Intended use: Fun daily<\/p>\n\n<p>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: A lot.

I kind of feel like I&#39;m chasing something that doesn&#39;t exist- a cheap, powerful, reliable, comfortable car that&#39;s fun to drive and has a decent interior. I like my Fiesta, it handles great and is very dramatic, but it&#39;s objectively slow and not the most comfortable place to spend time. What I want is a Miata that&#39;s 20% larger with 100 more horsepower.<\/p>\n<\/div>","2":"<div class=\"md\"><p><strong>Location:<\/strong> Germany, Rheinland-Pfalz, imports from US\/Japan are an option<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Price range:<\/strong> 20.000-30.000\u20ac<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Lease or Buy:<\/strong> Buy<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>New or used:<\/strong> new or used<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Type of vehicle:<\/strong> Sports Car<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Must haves:<\/strong> AWD<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc): manual<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Intended use:<\/strong> Weekend Car, maybe daily<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered:<\/strong> Lancer EVO 8\/9, Subaru WRX STI, Focus RS MK3, Yaris GR<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Is this your 1st vehicle:<\/strong> no<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you need a Warranty:<\/strong> no<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> yes<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> suspension, a little bit engine<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Additional Notes:<\/strong> should be tuneable to 400hp upwards<\/p>\n<\/div>","3":"<div class=\"md\"><p><strong>Location:<\/strong> USA (Missouri)<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Price range:<\/strong> (6k USD)<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Lease or Buy: Buy<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>New or used: Used<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Type of vehicle: Sports car, hatchback, fun to drive eco, etc.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Must haves:<\/strong> manual transmission, gas\/petrol engine, fun to drive, preferably relatively economical (at least 25 mpg would be nice but not neccesary)<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc): manual<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Intended use:<\/strong> (Daily Driver, Family Car, Weekend Car, Track Toy, Project Car, Work Truck, Off roading etc.)<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: Golf gti, Rx-7 fc, fb, and sa, mx-5\/miata, civic si, e36 and e46 3 series, mazdaspeed 3 and 6, 5th and 3rd gen celica, CRX, Del Sol, 5th and 4th gen prelude<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Is this your 1st vehicle: yes<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you need a Warranty: no<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> yes<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> clutch, suspension, and zip ties lol<\/p>\n<\/div>","4":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: Germany, Frankfurt Metropolitan<\/p>\n\n<p>Price range: \u20ac16500 max<\/p>\n\n<p>Lease or Buy: Buy<\/p>\n\n<p>New or used: 1-2 y\/o<\/p>\n\n<p>Type of vehicle: Hatchback<\/p>\n\n<p>Must haves: Air conditioner<\/p>\n\n<p>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc): Doesn&#39;t matter, but considering the price - most probably manual<\/p>\n\n<p>Intended use: Small Family Car<\/p>\n\n<p>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: Hyundai i30, VW Golf 7, Kia Ceed<\/p>\n\n<p>Is this your 1st vehicle: No, have a Golf 4 currently<\/p>\n\n<p>Do you need a Warranty: definitely<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle: yes<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle: no<\/p>\n\n<p>Additional Notes:<\/p>\n\n<p>So basically I&#39;m bought by Hyndai\/Kias&#39; enormous warranty, compared to other brands.

I was set on the brz but after doing a bit more research I&#39;ve realized that maintenance is a pain in the ass and very expensive. Do I really want to drop $2k every 100k for a head gasket replacement on the brz, not to mention the pain of changing the spark plugs. Then there&#39;s the fact that they&#39;re much louder on the freeway. In addition the insurance on these is far higher that the miata. So really the only upside vs a miata is the extra space. But that space is important if I want to take this car on road trips. I already have an SUV that my wife drives, so I don&#39;t really need the ability to take it on road trips, but it would be nice because of the lower fuel costs.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now I&#39;m looking the ecoboost mustang as an alternative, but that&#39;s in an entirely different class of cars.<\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m in the far northwest of california if that matters.<\/p>\n<\/div>","12":"<div class=\"md\"><p><strong>Location:<\/strong> SF Bay Area, California<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Price range:<\/strong> ~$25,000-$30,000, not very firm<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Lease or Buy:<\/strong> Buy (unless leasing is way smarter right now?)<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>New or used:<\/strong> New<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Type of vehicle:<\/strong> Sporty hatchback or sedan<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Must haves:<\/strong> Good Manual transmission, fun to drive, relatively practical\/fuel efficient, usable interior (backseats are a plus), cool styling<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Desired transmission:<\/strong> Manual<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Intended use:<\/strong> Commute (~30 miles each way daily) and fun<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered:<\/strong> Civic Hatch Sport, Mazda3 Hatch, Veloster Turbo\/N, Golf GTI, WRX, Impreza Sport Hatch, 86\/BRZ\/Miata<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Is this your 1st vehicle:<\/strong> Not first ever car, but first new car<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you need a Warranty:<\/strong> Preferably a good warranty, yes<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> Yes<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> No, but open to learning if necessary<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Additional Notes:<\/strong> <\/p>\n\n<p>I was looking at used cars but prices are ridiculous right now so I&#39;m leaning towards something new that holds its value well.

This also means I won&#39;t really be able to test drive these cars before buying, only the auto versions which might not be representative. There&#39;s gonna be a bit of a leap of faith here no matter what. I commute off peak hours most of the time, but there is the occasional stop and go traffic on the freeway. <\/p>\n\n<p>I guess I&#39;m wondering which of these are the most fun and engaging to drive, while not breaking the bank in terms of reliability and gas.

The most affordable. Test driving the auto version felt really floaty and numb, not sure how different the manual would be.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Mazda3 Hatch:<\/strong> Everything about this car seems great. Beautiful exterior and interior, solid fuel economy, good transmission from what I&#39;ve read, etc, EXCEPT I&#39;ve heard it&#39;s sluggish and disconnected, more of a luxury car than a fun car. Probably my number two right now. If only the turbo came in manual :(<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Veloster Turbo\/N:<\/strong> The N is pricey but seems solid for what I&#39;m looking for. Not as great as the Mazda3 at everything, but the driving feel is more engaging. Maybe one of the Turbo trims would be a good way to drop the costs a bit and keep some of the fun factor. I haven&#39;t been able to test drive one yet and the Hyundai dealers around me seem pretty bad, so that hurts it a bit. Still, I&#39;m leaning here as my number one at the moment.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Golf GTI:<\/strong> Not a fan of German cars because of the unreliability after a few years, but I&#39;ve heard great things from my friends about these.

Also, the transmission seems rough as a learner and the interior is pretty bad.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Impreza Sport Hatch:<\/strong> Not as cool as the WRX and shares similar interior issues, but better with fuel and insurance.

It&#39;d be nice to have something I can take to Tahoe or on service roads without worry. I&#39;m brand\/community agnostic - mostly looked at German cars before buying a Camaro.<\/p>\n\n<p>I understand if this super vague post doesn&#39;t get replies, but I&#39;m interested in hearing outside opinions on what might fit my lifestyle that aren&#39;t the same few cars I feel like I&#39;ve conditioned myself to think about as I consider the possibility of making a significant profit on my current car.<\/p>\n<\/div>","23":"<div class=\"md\"><p><strong>Location:<\/strong>  Redding, Ca<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Price range:<\/strong> Max $15,000<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Lease or Buy:<\/strong>   Buy! \n<strong>New or used:<\/strong>   Used <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Type of vehicle:<\/strong> car   <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Must haves:<\/strong> it has to be roomy, I\u2019m in my mid twenties and I know I\u2019ll be moving at least 4 more times in my life and a packable car is a must.  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc):<\/strong><br\/>\nAuto \n<strong>Intended use:<\/strong> (Daily Driver, Family Car, Weekend Car, Track Toy, Project Car, Work Truck, Off roading etc.)   Daily driver <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered:<\/strong>    <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Is this your 1st vehicle:<\/strong>   No<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you need a Warranty:<\/strong>   I have no idea, it sounds nice! <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> (fluids, alternator, battery, brake pads etc)<br\/>\nThe battery is probably about it. \n<strong>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> (engine and transmission, timing belt\/chains, body work, suspension etc )<br\/>\nNope \n<strong>Additional Notes:<\/strong><br\/>\nMy 2007 Honda Accord is dying.

There is ALOT of mixed opinions on 350z&#39;s to what I can see. Bottom line is personally I love the appearance of the 350z and I really like the idea of tastefully modifying one. I would only be using it on the weekends as I have a Golf TDI for commuting.<\/p>\n\n<p>My true issue is I cant quite work out what 350z&#39;s are really like.<\/p>\n\n<p>I know an obvious answer would be to test drive one. But in all honesty I find test drives often to be very difficult to get a true feel of the car and how much you enjoy it, especially only driving like a few miles often in a town or city and with the car owner\/garage employee.<\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve read previously someone refer to the 350 as &#39;more of a muscle car than a sports car&#39;. I dont find this hard to believe given the 3.5l lump and the weight that comes with a coupe. It would make sense as they seem super popular in the USA. But what about the UK? I want a good B road basher. Is this the wrong car choice for me?<\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve owned a MX-5 mk2 1.8l, and it&#39;s the most fun car i&#39;ve owned to date. The ONLY thing i couldnt put up with was the lack of power.<\/p>\n\n<p>The 350z entises me due to the following things;<\/p>\n\n<p>HP &amp; Troque of the beutiful 3.5l V6 but also the sound of these engines with the right exhaust setup when they scream. (I&#39;m aware stock and some aftermarket exhaust dont sound too great)<\/p>\n\n<p>RWD + LSD + Manual = Too much fun<\/p>\n\n<p>General asthetics &amp; Mod capabilty<\/p>\n\n<p>there are more things but that&#39;s the main ones.<\/p>\n\n<p>Biggest conerns for me would be;<\/p>\n\n<p>what do they ACTUALLY handle like. Is it going to be fun on B roads? That&#39;s where she will be used most. Will it grip well when I want it too in the dry giving it stick round corners or do they oversteer to much? given some good performing Tires of course.<\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve heard the gearbox&#39;s are horendous but are they really that bad? does it feel very disconnected and horrible to drive? Are they that unreliable?<\/p>\n\n<p>Is it that heavy that it dulls out the feel of the power? Power to weight has always been a big thing to me. I dont need something weighing under a tonne. But is it just going to feel like boat?<\/p>\n\n<p>They are cheap for what they are, they really are.. Does that tell me all I need to know?<\/p>\n\n<p>I would be buying a DE not a HR, purely down to the price point, I really cant see it being worth how much more the HR&#39;s are listed for in comparison to the DE.<\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m on the line with a 350. Part of me thinks a Porshe Cayman 05-13 might be a better choice or perhaps a BMW Z4 35i especially for B roads. TBH these are out of my budget, but I may be inclined to wait if the 350 is a no go! (Any other car suggestions would be interesting)<\/p>\n\n<p>If I&#39;m honest I just think I&#39;ll always have a soft spot for the 350z and It&#39;s a car that&#39;s been growing on me more and more, I just really dont want to be dissapointed though. There is alot more I could say or ask but in all honest I just want you generous peoples brutally honest opinions!<\/p>\n<\/div>","180":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: Texas \nPrice range : 20,000$ max \nLease or buy: buy \nNew or used: either \nType of vehicle: coupe, sports car \nDesired transmission: manual but auto is fine \nIntended use: drive and look good and maybe mod later down the line \nVehicles I\u2019ve considered: all nizzan slkrts cars from 1990 on, Toyota 86\/frs\/Brz, wrx, Supra MK3, etc..<\/p>\n\n<p>Is this my first car: yes \nNo warranty needed \nCan you do minor work: yes \nCan you do major work: depends<\/p>\n<\/div>","181":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: Canada<\/p>\n\n<p>Price range: ~20000 to 30000CAD <\/p>\n\n<p>Lease or Buy: Buy<\/p>\n\n<p>New or used: Used<\/p>\n\n<p>Type of vehicle: Estate or SUV<\/p>\n\n<p>Must haves: Can fit 3 car seats, reliability and safety a must, reasonable mileage<\/p>\n\n<p>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc): manual preferred<\/p>\n\n<p>Intended use: Daily driver, transporting kids<\/p>\n\n<p>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: Toyata corolla, Toyota RAV4, Honda CRV, Kia Sorento, Hyundai Sante Fe, Skoda superb estate, Volvo xc70 or Volvo estate<\/p>\n\n<p>Is this your 1st vehicle: No, current vehicle is a VW polo 1.4TD, 13 years old and minimal issues with regular maintenance and new timing belt\/clutch in last couple of years<\/p>\n\n<p>Do you need a Warranty: No<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle: Yes<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle: No<\/p>\n\n<p>Additional Notes: Im possibly moving to Toronto in the next year or so from Europe.

I like my Jetta but I don\u2019t get much joy out of driving it anymore, and I miss the old-school limited technology car vibe that I had with my Monte Carlo, hence the reason I am considering something else older. My question is, how reliable (or unreliable) would the 26 year old SC400 be in comparison to my 5 year old Jetta and should I keep my Jetta or trade it in for the SC400 I\u2019ve found?<\/p>\n<\/div>","215":"<div class=\"md\"><p>So kind of a weird request.
