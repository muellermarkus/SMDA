It needs to be decently reliable (I can deal with a few repairs now and then), able to fit three people and their camping gear, and be somewhat fun to drive. Mileage isn&#39;t a huge concern for me, but I would like at least 18-20 MPG highway. The car will need to last at least 3-4 years of consistent driving.<\/p>\n\n<p>At the moment, I&#39;m really only considering a sedan or a wagon. I have no need for luxury or anything fancy, though comfortable seats are a big plus because my tall, skinny, bony ass falls asleep easily on road trips (of which there will be a few). A wagon or a big trunk is really just nice because I can fit my bike in without needing a rack, and it&#39;s a custom bike which I would worry about a little hanging off the back or sitting on top of the car.

I wouldn&#39;t mind an 850 sedan\/wagon or S\/V-40\/60\/70, but I&#39;m concerned about their reliability. Their seats are amazing, though, and I&#39;d buy them for those alone.

Reasons: way too slow, crappy MPGs in busy traffic, crappy build quality, crappy ride quality, crappy everything.<\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m looking at diesel hatchbacks as MPGs are quite important but I&#39;d like something a bit more interesting than your average 1.6 diesel Focus\/Golf.<\/p>\n\n<p>A good friend is selling his Boxer Diesel Subaru Impreza. Made in 2009, 137000km(85K miles), 2litre 150hp diesel with a 6 speed manual. Extra features: leather seats, keyless go&amp;entry, sunroof, xenon headlights. Price: 9000eur<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>What I like about it<\/strong>: it drives really nice, the engine is powerful enough for my needs, that sweet AWD (which is really useful considering we have snowy winters), it&#39;s not your average crappy hatchback as Subarus are not very common here and I trust him. We&#39;re good friends for quite some time and he owns a repair shop which focuses on Subarus (he used to own a small Subaru dealership as well). He bought the car from Germany last year and wants to sell it because he&#39;s looking for something more powerful. He replaced everything that needed to be replaced in the car (he worked on all of my cars and he always did a good and responsible job) and told me that atm there is absolutely nothing wrong with it. It&#39;s not the first time I&#39;m buying a used car so I&#39;m well aware that anything can go wrong with it even though it drives just fine now.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>What I don&#39;t like about it<\/strong>: It&#39;s a bit old. So it&#39;s almost 8 years old and it&#39;s got 137000km. If I&#39;d get a diesel Focus, I could get one that&#39;s 5 years old and with less than 100.000km. Sure, the Subaru drives better and it&#39;s definitely nicer than a Focus but would it last as much? I&#39;m planning to hold on to it for 4-5 years.
