Other cars in contention for primary DD role, Honda Accord, Golf GTI\nIf going Accord or GTI would consider something like a Cayman S or Corvette C6 - Grand Sport (love these cars).  <\/p>\n\n<p>The true cost to own of the Corvette is significantly less than the Cayman, I have access to a buddies garage\/tools that would make working on the Vette much easier than the Porsche.  I&#39;ve owned a C5 Z06 in the past, fun car, track worthy but tough to drive during the week.  The C6 is quieter, better built and has bluetooth which would allow some calls while driving one or two days a week to the office.  <\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve always been a sports sedan guy so there is tremendous appeal for an M3 or GSF.  To be honest, yes the M3 is more capable but the GSF is probably the front runner, slightly bigger inside, very well put together.  Excellent warranty and our Lexus dealer experience is much better than BMW here.  I can also be assured that the Lexus will take track days and eat them up with no reliability issues.  I also suspect the GSF will hold its value better than the M3.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Another possible combination would be GSF + C5 Coupe...\nWhat else am I missing or should I consider?  The cost to own on the GTI and Accord are really low which is appealing, but I do earn a good living and I like cars so spending some money on vehicles is OK too.  <\/p>\n\n<p>What&#39;s Reddit think?<\/p>\n<\/div>","3":"<div class=\"md\"><pre><code>    Location: Canada \/ Saskatchewan (willing to travel most of Canada to find something)\n    Price range: Around the $20,000 mark\n    Lease or Buy: Buy\n    New or used: Used\n    Type of vehicle: SUV\n    Must haves: AWD + trunk space (I have a Great Dane)\n    Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc): Auto\n    Intended use:  Daily\/Family\n    Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: Ford Escape, Toyota Sequoia, RAM 1500\n    Is this your 1st vehicle: No\n    Do you need a Warranty: No\n    Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle: Yes\n    Can you do Major work on your own vehicle: No\n\n    Additional Notes:\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I&#39;m looking at going from my Discovery Sport to something cheaper<\/li>\n<li>I&#39;ve looked at the Toyota Sequoia but the ones in my price range seem to be around the 200,000km mark.

If it doesn&#39;t entail anything serious and I should be able to look up what I need to do, then yes.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle<\/strong>: Definitely\/probably not. I might be able to learn though - I have access to public work-on-your-car-stations that might possibly contain tools to do major work. Answer is still probably no though. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Additional Notes<\/strong>: TL;DR: I want a performancey or fun vehicle that looks good, can haul 4-5 people, has decent or good trunk space, reasonable interior refinement and amenities, and has good reliability given routine care, at the best price.<\/p>\n\n<p>Detailed random notes:\nI&#39;ve actually wanted the WRX since I was in high school in like 2011; now that I have a career job, I still pretty much want the WRX - but at the same time I&#39;ve given notice to practicality, refinement, and cost efficiency - the WRX resale value is ridiculous, so if I were to buy it used I might as well buy it new (espically since WRX drivers aren&#39;t the most &#39;keep vehicle stock&#39; safer driver kind of owners as it is); then, I could get a used GTI for almost half the price of a new WRX. The GTI also has all the refinements that the WRX doesn&#39;t have, but the GTI doesn&#39;t have as much exterior sex appeal as the WRX (GTI doesn&#39;t look bad though!). Also, I refuse to buy a WRX in a CVT, and because I can&#39;t drive manual thats also kind of holding me back.\nWRX PROS: AWD, sex appeal, reliablity, fun, car i&#39;ve wanted forever\nWRX CONS: cant drive manual, new is expensive, plain interior, no android auto stock, loud cabin with bumpy ride?, i dont actually need AWD\nGTI - literally the opposite of the WRX\nPROS - will get in DSG auto, can get used, refined interior, stock android auto for 2016+\nCONS - FWD (doesn&#39;t really matter though), more normal and less sex appeal, unreliable?, not as fun\nI&#39;ve been cross shopping other potential hot hatches like the hyundai elantra GT sport, and the veloster N thats coming out later; I have an unfair bias AGAINST american hot hatches (ford fiesta and focus ST) because I have some sort of bias that they aren&#39;t very reliable, and lack the refinement that of the GTI (which I also think isn&#39;t that reliable). Please talk me out of this bias if it is actually unreasonable. I also kind of (but not really) cross shoped used luxury sedans like the IS250, and higher ground clearance vehicles.
