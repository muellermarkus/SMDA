Help me decide which car to buy.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>I already know what car I&#39;m getting so the above format suggestion doesn&#39;t really apply to me. I just want an opinion on two cars.<\/p>\n\n<p>Option 1: made in 2015 MY14 Toyota Corolla Ascent Sport with 38,000km, red colour, 6 months registration, $15,500, has factory window tinting<\/p>\n\n<p>Option 2: made in 2016 MY16 Toyota Corolla Ascent with 65,000km, white colour, 2 months registration, $15,000<\/p>\n\n<p>Both are automatic, hatchbacks,  private sale and in Western Australia. The car is for my Mum who is around 70 years old, 5 foot 2, and is good enough to play league of legends in Gold. From my understanding the 2016 car weighs 35kg less and therefore has  6.1L\/100km compared to 6.6L\/100km. 35kg seems like a lot to me, did they compromise the engine or something to achieve that? Is there any major differences between the MY16 vs MY14 in terms of ride quality or anything like that.<\/p>\n\n<p>Her current car is a 2000 Avalon Conquest. When she drove a friend&#39;s 2005 Camry Altise she complained the ride wasn&#39;t as smooth and it was a bit slow.<\/p>\n<\/div>","79":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Location:<\/strong> Boston  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Price range:<\/strong> 8k - 15k (don&#39;t want to spend any more than 18k after taxes\/fees)  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Lease or Buy:<\/strong> buy  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>New or used:<\/strong> probably used given the price range  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Type of vehicle:<\/strong> cars on the smaller side, compact\/ hatchback.
