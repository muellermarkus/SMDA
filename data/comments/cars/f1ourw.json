I do not need a truck, but I need something I fit in. I am looking to upgrade to something I fit in better than my current car. It is a 2014 Crosstour V6. My kneecaps are close to touching the dash, and the bottom of the steering wheel.  I do haul larger items at times as well. Three times a month on average. Enough for me to justify a vehicle with a waist-level bed. Driving varies between highway, tighter city streets and parking garages, and country roads. The back seat area will be used for extra internal storage space.  <\/p>\n\n<p>I think the jack of all trades would be the Ranger. I had heard one of the Ecoboosts has the water pump inside the engine block rather than outside and can be costly if it breaks. However, I do not know if the 2.3 4-banger is that one.   <\/p>\n\n<p>The 150 with the V8 would be my second option. The 3.5 EB is okay, but the idea of a twin turbo engine in a half ton doesn&#39;t jive with me if one of them goes out. Additionally it is a larger vehicle (not by much probably), but is in the same price range as the Rangers in my area ($38K for a reasonably spec&#39;d crew cab XLT vs $33-ish for a Ranger crew cab).   <\/p>\n\n<p>The Dodge, well, it&#39;s a Dodge, and I&#39;ve heard mixed things on quality of the MDS Hemi with the cams and lifters after so many miles.
