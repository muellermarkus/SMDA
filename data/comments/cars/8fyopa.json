My first car and car that I drove through high school and college was a 1990 Honda Prelude and I loved that car.  Since then I&#39;ve also owned an &#39;03 Mazda6 and &#39;08 Honda Accord.  I own my pickup outright and really enjoy not having a car payment and based on what I&#39;ve seen for possible trade-in value of my truck the Focus and GTi seemed like they would require little if any cash out of my pocket to get.  I could certainly afford much more vehicle than either of those but it doesn&#39;t seem financially responsible at this time.  It may seem strange to also have listed an M3 but I&#39;ve always been enamored by that car and would like to own one at some point (even though I&#39;ve never driven a remotely sporty vehicle).  I&#39;m really open to considering any vehicle at this point that I could drive on a daily basis and that I can enjoy driving and possibly looking for justification to spending way more money than I should.<\/p>\n<\/div>","1":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: BC Canada<\/p>\n\n<p>Price range: 0-6000<\/p>\n\n<p>Lease or Buy: Buy<\/p>\n\n<p>New or used: Errrrr hmmm<\/p>\n\n<p>Type of vehicle: Weekend rocket<\/p>\n\n<p>Must haves: Fun as hell<\/p>\n\n<p>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc): Manual only<\/p>\n\n<p>Intended use: Weekend ripper, road tripper<\/p>\n\n<p>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: RX-8, Miata<\/p>\n\n<p>Is this your 1st vehicle: Nope, have a Juke daily<\/p>\n\n<p>Do you need a Warranty: Ha!<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle: Yes<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle: No<\/p>\n\n<p>Additional Notes: Let&#39;s go!

Thanks in advance for any recommendations!<\/p>\n<\/div>","13":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location:  Manitoba, Canada<\/p>\n\n<p>Price Range: Under $35000 after tax. Payments are more important, around $400 a month. <\/p>\n\n<p>Lease or Buy: Eh. Either I guess, if I can end up with a car I like significantly more by leasing, I&#39;ll do it. <\/p>\n\n<p>New or Used: Either, but newer if used. <\/p>\n\n<p>Type: Car<\/p>\n\n<p>Must haves: 2 Doors, not FWD. Fun. I care more about handling than pure power. A\/C and heating, some form of phone connectivity, and some way to play music from my phone. Aux cord\/ Bluetooth\/ whatever.<\/p>\n\n<p>Transmission: Manual preferably but I&#39;ll go with auto if I have to. <\/p>\n\n<p>Intended use: Daily, my commute is about 20-40 minutes on highway either way, plus I do a solid amount of generic driving in the city and along backroads. Very occasional (&lt; 2 per year) trips of a couple hours on highway. <\/p>\n\n<p>Already Considered vehicles: Subaru BRZ, Fiat 124, Miata, WRX (I know it&#39;s not a 2 door but my cousin insisted it was worth a try)<\/p>\n\n<p>1st Vehicle: No <\/p>\n\n<p>Warranty: Yes<\/p>\n\n<p>Minor work: yes<\/p>\n\n<p>Major work: no<\/p>\n\n<p>Notes: Of the vehicles I&#39;ve considered, the BRZ is probably my favourite. The Miata is too small for me to daily comfortably, and I don&#39;t really like the look of the WRX although it is fun to drive. I haven&#39;t driven a 124, but I understand it&#39;s <em>very<\/em> similar to the Miata. I believe I can get more features\/higher trim level from a BRZ compared to a 124 for the same price anyways, although I really like the way the 124 looks. Not to mention I don&#39;t love the idea of dealing with FCA or Chrysler itself (no Fiat dealer in my town) if something goes wrong, I&#39;ve heard bad things. <\/p>\n\n<p>My last car is\/was a C300, which I&#39;ve driven for a good few years. I like it well enough, but want to try something sportier while I&#39;m still young and don&#39;t need to worry much about things like a back seat. I also want to make the shift to something more focused on sport than luxury, and because I subscribe to the idea that it&#39;s more fun to drive a slow car fast, the BRZ caught my eye. <\/p>\n\n<p>Basically, I&#39;m wondering if there&#39;s any other cars that fit these restrictions\/goals that I&#39;ve missed, or anything else about the cars I mentioned that I should consider. Thanks in advance for any advice!<\/p>\n<\/div>","14":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Reposting with some changes and formatting<\/p>\n\n<p>--Location: Northeast Ohio- --Price Range: $1000-$5,500-\n--Lease or Buy?: Buy. -\n--New or Used: Used-\n--Type of vehicle: hatchback-\n--Must haves: none. -\n--Disired transmission: manual -\n--Intended use: daily driver-\n--Vehicles already considered: none.
