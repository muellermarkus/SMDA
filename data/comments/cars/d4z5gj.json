They&#39;re teaching me to appreciate cars through the generations a lot more. I&#39;m leaning more towards cars from the 80&#39;s-90&#39;s because they have a look I like. The Toyota Sprinter Trueno and the 1988 Toyota MR2 for example. I really like angular cars. They have this firm look to them that I appreciate a lot more than the jelly blobs and jagged knives of modern cars. One of the down sides with older cars is that I&#39;ve only been able to find videos reviewing them by guys who love cars and display them in the best possible light. However there are going to be several months out of the year where I&#39;m driving the car at 2 a.m. in heavy rain\/snow for 2+ hours. Sooo... It&#39;s not going to be all straightaways and smooth mountain passes. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Is this your 1st vehicle:<\/strong> Yes, but technically no.

So, now is the time to tell me to give up on cars from the 80&#39;s-90&#39;s if you think it&#39;d be a bad financial\/safety choice for someone who doesn&#39;t have unlimited disposable income.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT:<\/strong> after looking at the costs of buying a car from that time in the modern day I realize how much of a fool I made myself out to be saying $20k was my limit, for 2 years no less. I&#39;m surprised I got any responses since that was my opener haha. It&#39;s a shame that most of the cars from that era I&#39;ve been seeing go for sale for at least $50k.

Stock these are about 280hp and modded it&#39;s about 350 with Haldex all wheel drive. I DD it and enjoy taking it to the track but only go a couple of times a year, so not heavy track use. My top end budget is in the low $60&#39;s. I&#39;d prefer new but would be willing to look at a 1-2 year old vehicle if it checked the right boxes.<\/p>\n\n<p>Here are the things I like about the R that I&#39;d love to find in my new car: - Fun to drive, a good amount of power with the handling to carry the power through a corner - Sober looks. I&#39;m middle aged and would hate the whole &quot;mid life crisis&quot;thing as I crawl out of a &#39;Vette or Z3 or something. Plus I just love being the unassuming looking Q car that shocks the ricers (I know, pure ego) - Room. I&#39;m a big guy (tall and wide) and for a trackable car, this thing doesn&#39;t feel cramped, I can even comfortably wear a helmet in there - 4 doors. Not essential as we don&#39;t have kids or anything but I&#39;d like to be able to carry 4 adults when I need to<\/p>\n\n<p>Here are things I don&#39;t have now that I&#39;d like to gain: - active cruise control - the peace of mind of a newer car with the warranty etc -More power. I enjoy my R but would love to step up to the next level, especially with twin turbo or big natural aspiration that gives torque throughout the power curve - Adjustable ride control. Right now my R is a tough ride, especially for passengers. The ability to soften the steering and suspension some, especially for longer rides, would be welcome - Then there&#39;s a bunch of nice to haves like android auto, remote start, memory seats etc<\/p>\n\n<p>Finally, I am 6&#39;2&quot; and a lot of my height is in my body, so there&#39;s a bunch of cars I don&#39;t fit in. I test drove an Audi RS3 and sat in a used RS5 but with the seats all the way down, and with the seat back in anything like a driving position, I had to tilt my head to the right (into the sunroof well) to fit, and that&#39;s without a helmet.<\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve thought about the following cars, what are your thoughts:<\/p>\n\n<p>BMW M2: I&#39;d lose AWD and I don&#39;t mind the brand but I&#39;m not crazy about it<\/p>\n\n<p>Dodge Hellcat: Lots of fun horsepower, but I lose the AWD again. I would definitely fit, even with helmet. Although it&#39;s a &quot;sporty&quot; car I feel like it doesn&#39;t have the same &quot;mid life crisis&quot; connotations<\/p>\n\n<p>19 Golf R: They are not making a 20 R for the US market, but I could spend less, get a more modern R with the features I&#39;m looking for and spend some of the saved money on mods.<\/p>\n\n<p>Keep the car. I could keep the car I have for track days and go get a cheaper commuter vehicle with the features I&#39;m looking for. This is probably my least favorite option because I want to be able to enjoy it on the road and don&#39;t want to deal with twice the servicing or issues that arise from lack of use...<\/p>\n\n<p>So, thoughts?<\/p>\n<\/div>","8":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: Austin, TX<\/p>\n\n<p>Price Range: &lt;5000<\/p>\n\n<p>Lease or Buy: Buy<\/p>\n\n<p>New or Used: Used<\/p>\n\n<p>Type of vehicle: Car<\/p>\n\n<p>Desired Transmission: Manual<\/p>\n\n<p>Intended use: Weekend Car\/Project Car<\/p>\n\n<p>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: Mazda Miata, 240sx, Acura Integra, Honda Civic<\/p>\n\n<p>Is this your first vehicle: No<\/p>\n\n<p>Do you need a Warranty: No<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle: Yes<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle: No<\/p>\n\n<p>Additional Notes:<\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m looking to finally get into the car scene with something basic for starters.

I&#39;ve heard that miata prices are starting to go up, so if it&#39;s unlikely to find one under $5k, what would be another good car to start with? I currently drive a &#39;15 civic, and while I love it as a daily, I think I&#39;d prefer rwd for a weekend car though I&#39;d be willing to go with fwd if the right car comes along.<\/p>\n<\/div>","9":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[gel\u00f6scht]<\/p>\n<\/div>","10":"<div class=\"md\"><p>&#x200B;<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Location:<\/strong> Southern Ontario (Canada)  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Price range:<\/strong> Maximum $20000 CAD  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Lease or Buy:<\/strong> Buy  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>New or used:<\/strong> Used   <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Type of vehicle:<\/strong> Car, Sedan  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Must haves:<\/strong> AWD, Fuel Efficient, Reliable, Easy to maintain, Bluetooth  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc):<\/strong> Auto   <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Intended use:<\/strong> Daily driver (school, work, hanging out with friends, etc)  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered:<\/strong> Honda Civic  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Is this your 1st vehicle:<\/strong> Yes  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you need a Warranty:<\/strong> No  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> Yes (oil change, brake pads, battery, etc)  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> No  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Additional Notes:<\/strong> The winters get bad here and there is a shit ton of snow and ice, so (especially as a first car\/new driver), gotta be safe in that<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<\/div>","11":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[gel\u00f6scht]<\/p>\n<\/div>","12":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Location:<\/strong> Pittsburgh, PA  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Price range:<\/strong> 3000 USD  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Lease or Buy: Buy<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>New or used: Used<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Type of vehicle:<\/strong> Car  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Must haves:<\/strong> Reliable, Winter driving  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc): Automatic<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Intended use:<\/strong> Winter beater for when I garage my 370z  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: Considering Honda CRV, Toyota Corolla<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Is this your 1st vehicle: No<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you need a Warranty: No<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> I can do oil changes and other basic maintenance  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> No  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Additional Notes: What is the most reliable car that requires very little maintenance and works well in winter<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<\/div>","13":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: Texas<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Price range: 15-20k<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Lease or Buy: buy, cash. <\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 New or used: used<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Type of vehicle: hatchback, sporty, fun...<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Must haves: fuel efficient<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Desired transmission auto<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Intended use: daily use<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: Veloster (2019\/2016), mazda mx5 (2016), Honda HRV (2016). <\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Is this your 1st vehicle: no<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Do you need a Warranty: no.  <\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle: (fluids, alternator, battery, brake pads etc) yes<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Can you do Major work on your own vehicle: (engine and transmission, timing belt\/chains, body work, suspension etc ) <\/p>\n\n<p>No<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Additional Notes: buying by the end of year.<\/p>\n<\/div>","14":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: AUSTRALIA, Melbourne<\/p>\n\n<p>Price Range: $9000<\/p>\n\n<p>Lease or Buy: I don\u2019t want to lease and I already have the cash.<\/p>\n\n<p>New or Used: Used<\/p>\n\n<p>Type of vehicle: Sporty car, i constantly watch supercar videos on youtube so im into sleek looking cars.<\/p>\n\n<p>Must Haves: nothing in particular, just something that if something does happen is cheaper to fix.<\/p>\n\n<p>Desired Transmission: I\u2019d prefer an automatic unless I was getting a really good deal on a manual.\nThis is meant to be a daily driver.<\/p>\n\n<p>Vehicles I\u2019ve considered: Nissan 350z is what ive really really been into.<\/p>\n\n<p>This is my first car for myself, drove a rusted up rav 4 that my family owned but am moving out.<\/p>\n\n<p>Do I need a warranty: A warranty is always nice but as long as it\u2019s reliable enough that I shouldn\u2019t need one I\u2019m okay with that.<\/p>\n\n<p>Minor\/Major work?

Should I try to convince the dealer to update the map system or stick to Waze on my phone?\nOne of the people trying to convince me to run away has had a similar model for only two years and is already looking at $1000 of engine work. Do these engines have a habit of breaking early? I have had no problems with the Colorado within the first 30,000 miles and the Equinox only has 8000 miles more. <\/p>\n\n<p>Any other reasons to not get this model? It\u2019s mostly very positively reviewed and I did enjoy the test drive.

Hence, why I love 90s econoboxes.<\/p>\n\n<p>Preferred Options: Power windows\/locks, cruise control, a decent aftermarket would be nice, but as long as I can put in my pre-existing head unit, I&#39;ll be content<\/p>\n\n<p>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc): Automatic, but manual if need be. My project car was what I intended to learn stick with.<\/p>\n\n<p>Intended use: Commuter car to work (15-20min I-95 commute), traveling to Philly\/Baltimore\/NYC when need be.<\/p>\n\n<p>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: A rebuilt &#39;09 Mitsubishi Galant from my colleague who flips cars (No way in Hell, but for $2500, I&#39;d be lying if it wasn&#39;t tempting). Honda Fit, Honda Civic, possibly an MK4 GTI or a E36 (I&#39;m willing to wrench on it, although, I&#39;d prefer not doing so every week)<\/p>\n\n<p>More Considerations: Rebuilding the Tercel, which is doable, but I don&#39;t know if I want to go through with it. It does burn a good bit of oil (Possible piston ring issue), my AC is intermittent (Haven&#39;t bothered to look into it), timing belt is coming up (Done @72k, currently has 126k), the rear drum brakes need to be done, and I could use new tires. If I were to get everything done, the cost would exceed the value of the car, but these cars, when maintained, last forever.<\/p>\n\n<p>Is this your 1st vehicle: No<\/p>\n\n<p>Do you need a Warranty: No<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle: Yes (Brake pads\/rotors, oil changes)<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle: (engine and transmission, timing belt\/chains, body work, suspension etc ): I&#39;m working on a project car, so it depends. I&#39;m willing to learn if there are a lot of resources available for reference. I rent out a garage space for my project car, so, that isn&#39;t an issue.<\/p>\n\n<p>Additional Notes: Preferably, I would like something slightly sporty, but I know that my budget doesn&#39;t give a lot of wiggle room. I could sell my project car (&#39;91 CRX Si), but it&#39;s stripped at the moment as I&#39;m fixing rust. I have a week off work next week, where I could try and fix everything so I could drive that instead, but I want to take my time on it instead. It&#39;s my personal hobby, and I would prefer that I do not give that up.<\/p>\n\n<p>If this is not enough insight as to what I am looking for, please let me know, and I&#39;ll be more than happy to provide more details.<\/p>\n<\/div>","105":"<div class=\"md\"><p>NYOOOOOOOOOOM<\/p>\n<\/div>","106":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Fiat 850. 1960s compact car.

The shame you have to endure with an auto miata is harsh. I had one, it&#39;s not a great transmission. For $4500 Cdn you can get an early 2000s Honda Civic with around 80,000kms on it. Set up a search on Kijiji that you save and check regularly. Also, used Saturns S-Series are solid used cars for way cheap. You can find some around 100,000km and will last to well over 250,000km with very cheap maintenance.
