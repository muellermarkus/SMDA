Big front windshield with good visibility angles helps a lot with this but is less required than a spacious drivers seat. <\/p>\n\n<p>Also, I don&#39;t intend to use this car to transport anything that cant fit in a small trunk.  I have a truck for that.  So passenger and rear seating \/ storage space is not a priority.  <\/p>\n\n<p>The final thing is that the car cant handle like complete shit in the snow.  It does not in any way have to be specifically good at it (i.e. no AWD requirement or anything) but I&#39;ve driven a number of cars and trucks that are complete garbage in the snow, much more so than to be expected.  So if snow tires are required, thats perfectly fine but this will be used in inclement weather and needs to be able to not activly try to kill me in the process.  <\/p>\n\n<p>So, does there exist something that has ample space for the drive while still being a fun, powerful car to drive?<\/p>\n<\/div>","17":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[gel\u00f6scht]<\/p>\n<\/div>","18":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: Northern Virginia\/DC Metro area (USA)<\/p>\n\n<p>Price Range: Up to 30k (35k if something really stands out)<\/p>\n\n<p>Buying new<\/p>\n\n<p>Type of vehicle: Sedan<\/p>\n\n<p>Must haves: Lots of technology bells and whistles (my goal is a car I can sit in, not remove the key from my pocket, start my podcasts and go - digital dashboards, HUDs, you name it.) \/ Fuel efficient \/ Comfortable for both long and short trips<\/p>\n\n<p>Automatic transmission required<\/p>\n\n<p>Intended use: Daily commuter car for short trips, and occasional work trips that last a few hours highway.<\/p>\n\n<p>Vehicles already considered: Honda Civic and Insight, VW Jetta, Toyota Prius and Camry<\/p>\n\n<p>Not my first vehicle - currently own a 2010 Kia Forte EX.<\/p>\n\n<p>A warranty would be good with a new car I\u2019d think!<\/p>\n\n<p>I could do VERY minor work in my car if you put a gun to my head and a YouTube tutorial in my hand.

Why do people sell them this early and at such a discount to their dealer price? What are common issues with this car and why are people not buying them?
