I live with my g\/f and her daughters, and she&#39;s my beneficiary.  Right now, however, I&#39;m relatively fine in my day to day life. So I have about $1M in fairly liquid assets and am thinking about a &quot;bucket list&quot; sports car.  Am I going to buy a $500K car?  No, because, well, I might live long enough to actually need that money.  So what would you do?  Would you buy a car?  Would you travel (I do plan to do that once this quarantine lifts and it&#39;s safer to do so)?  Would you buy a vacation home?
