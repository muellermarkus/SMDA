this has happened to some of us here, but I&#39;m beginning to have a space problem due to having too many cars. My driveway is very long, is gated and probably fits 5 reasonably sized vehicles but playing musical cars to do maintenance or go for a drive is not all that fun. I also have room for 2 in front of my house.<\/p>\n\n<p>I love all of em and don&#39;t really want to part with any but without having a large shop to store and maintain everything properly I&#39;m close to letting one go.<\/p>\n\n<p>2005 Porsche Carrera S \/ manual This one is great and the only one i don&#39;t own outright. Nicest car I own by far and does almost everything great. Has new ims, clutch, pse, plugs and coils within recent history. Leaning towards keeping until values go up or I wear it out. 35k invested, 20k owed.<\/p>\n\n<p>2000 Mazda miata ls \/mx5 \/ manual Picked this one up because I had the miata itch, it was cheap in great condition and perfect options. Leaning towards keeping this one also until I can teach my wife to drive manual and one of my friends makes me a good offer on it. 3k invested.<\/p>\n\n<p>1993 Nissan 240sx \/ sr20det \/ manual I&#39;ve had this car for 13 years now and have done a ton of work to it, motor swap, viscous diff, z32 brakes, 5 lug, 350z wheels, coil overs, sway bar, ect, ect. Car is stock body wise and in great shape. Values are a bit up on these but its impossible to sell a car with this many mods in California. Basically just use this as a cheap track day toy. 10k invested.<\/p>\n\n<p>1997 Jeep Cherokee \/ I6\/auto\/4x4 This ones in great mechanical shape but a bit rough due to paint and door dings. I was planning on selling this one but it kinda hurts and I&#39;m debating to non op it and mothball it up at my dads or to sell. Lots of miles. No rust. I&#39;m not sure where values will go on these. The really clean ones go for a lot but there is a lot of beat up ones out there. 4k invested.<\/p>\n\n<p>1995 Toyota Land Cruiser \/ auto This is my latest purchase and is supposed to be the new daily driver. I&#39;m still in the middle of replacing the shocks and springs and a few other interior bits. I love it but it&#39;s always a bit weird meeting your heros if that makes sense. I see why it&#39;s a great car but its harder to find parts than I expected due to age and rarity, something I wasn&#39;t expecting to encounter so soon. This was also bought so I can safely tow my nissan to the track and to have a bit safer daily then my old jeep. 6.5k invested.<\/p>\n\n<p>2004 Vespa et2 \/ 50cc two stroke \/ auto Bought this to help a friend learn how to ride. Used to ride it a bunch when I lived in the city now not so much. Storing this one isn&#39;t really a problem and I plan to non op it soon just to keep reg costs down. 1k invested.<\/p>\n\n<p>My wife has a 2013 Prius so a long haul commuter is already in the mix as well.<\/p>\n\n<p>Sorry for the long-winded post but please share your thoughts!<\/p>\n<\/div>","2":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Looking for a cheap towing car, the challenge being a 2600kg horse trailer, which no puny crossover can tow.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Location:<\/strong> Europe, Finland (diesel is around 1.2-1.3 \u20ac\/L, <em>for now<\/em>)<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Price range:<\/strong> 8-14k\u20ac<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Lease or Buy:<\/strong> Buy<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>New or used:<\/strong> Used<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Type of vehicle:<\/strong> SUV, crossover, estate-like body<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Must haves:<\/strong> Diesel engine, highway speed (up to 100kph) capable <em>continuous<\/em> AWD (no selecting 2WD\/4WD manually), electronic traction &amp; stability control, 3000kg towing capability or more, no air suspension.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc):<\/strong> Automatic<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Intended use:<\/strong> Daily Driver, towing car (at least once a week)<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Kia Sorento (no continuous AWD available)<\/p>\n\n<p>Jeep Grand Cherokee (reliability concerns &amp; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=zaYFLb8WMGM&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=22\">scary handling<\/a>; we live in moose country)<\/p>\n\n<p>Jeep Cherokee, Dodge Nitro (serious reliability concerns)<\/p>\n\n<p>The Germans; Q7\/X5\/M-class\/Touareg (very high running costs)<\/p>\n\n<p>Land Rover in general (very high running costs)<\/p>\n\n<p>Toyota Land Cruiser (cars in budget have generally done over 400 000 km)<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Minor\/Major work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> No<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Additional Notes:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Car has to be able to tow the 2600kg trailer comfortably, year-round, sometimes on poorly-maintained roads.

Technically a gasoline engine with a CNG conversion could work, but it would require rather large tanks not to necessitate filling up on CNG every day, and driving gasoline would still be expensive.

Now that I&#39;m more financially stable I want to buy a starter car that I can work on. I don&#39;t have any auto enthusiast friends, so I&#39;m on my own in this and will most likely be learning through YouTube\/forums\/FB groups.   <\/p>\n\n<p>The problem I&#39;m having is not knowing what would be a good platform to ease into learning car mechanics. I know how to do basics like check fluids\/do an oil change\/swap out a tire, and want to ramp up to performance eventually. I&#39;m naturally very handy and am comfortable using tools from my previous pastimes so I&#39;m confident in my ability to learn - just gotta commit and buy a car.  <\/p>\n\n<p>I love the idea of having an Evo 5+\/STI\/S2000 but I feel like they&#39;re too &#39;new&#39; for my beginner skill level and I don&#39;t want to buy a $10k+ car that I&#39;d worry about breaking. So, I&#39;m leaning towards getting an older (90s, 00s) used car that has potential to be built and has aftermarket support. I think I&#39;d feel more at ease working on an older car, but I know that could cause its own implications.<\/p>\n\n<p>As for car type, I enjoy sport sedans\/coupes and hot hatches! I currently drive a 2014 VW Golf and want to sell it sooner than later since I&#39;m not set on keeping it in the long term and it&#39;s just gonna lose value the longer I wait.

I may also consider a 997.<\/p>\n\n<p>I thought some sort of V8 American muscle might be cool too, like a Pontiac G8 or a Chevy SS. Those just exude coolness. <\/p>\n\n<p>In reality, I&#39;ve always wanted an A80 Supra Turbo, but those often seem to be just a bit outside of my budget. But, I started to look at the new Supra, and honestly those don&#39;t sound like a bad idea either. My only real problem is that it does not come with a manual (just my personal preference).<\/p>\n\n<p>I also have an NA Miata and an 09 Tacoma, so it wouldn&#39;t kill me if this car has to go down for a few days or even weeks for whatever reason. <\/p>\n\n<p>In conclusion, I&#39;m looking for suggestions for a fun, cool, car for the weekend that might also be used as a daily for a while!<\/p>\n<\/div>","53":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Location: South East USA<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Price range:<\/strong> 5-7k  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Lease or Buy: Buy<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>New or used: Used<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Type of vehicle:<\/strong> Sedan\/Wagon\/Hatch  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Must haves:<\/strong> V6  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc): Any<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Intended use:<\/strong> Daily Driver  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: I&#39;m open to anything<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Is this your 1st vehicle: Nope<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you need a Warranty: Nope<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> Yes  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> Some, but not major overhauls  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Additional Notes: Looking for reliability and a smooth ride.

Also, I don&#39;t like how it&#39;s as common as a Toyota Camry where I live - I just like the idea of having something you don&#39;t see often. Reviewers love the Veloster N but it looks a little too extra for me and the ride probably won&#39;t be nice, so I&#39;m leaning towards the GLI or GTI. Of those two, I think I prefer the GLI for now because I just like the look, think it&#39;s very uncommon for my area, and it&#39;s 6k cheaper than the GTI, but at the same time I&#39;ve been seeing many people talk about how the GTI is better and is the &quot;true car enthusiast car&quot; or a &quot;rite of passage.&quot; I think my ideal car would be a Golf R, but it&#39;s so hard to find a CPO with a manual transmission around my area.

Assuming I only use the car for 3 years max, is this a slam dunk? $339 x 12 months = $4058 a year. The first year is paid for by the rebate. Fuel is paid for. Maintenance is paid for.
