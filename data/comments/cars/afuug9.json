The fucker just runs and runs and runs. However, it has a rebuilt title so it&#39;s not worth that much, and it needs work currently. New shocks, new steering components, rear axle seal, timing belt service (around $1k by itself), new brakes,and I believe a new hydraulic clutch system, or at least master cylinder and lines. I can do everything but the timing belt service and transmission work myself. It starts and runs infallibly. I have a big dog and go skiing about 6 days a week (mornings before work mostly), so the storage space is very appreciated. I travel alot and can sleep in the back so it saves me money on hotels. But it also gets about 18-20 mpg, so is not cheap to drive. Insurance is about average. So basically I have a car that&#39;s worth maybe $4k on a good day (non rebuilt ones with similar spec go for around 8-10k here), that I&#39;m spending about $100 a week on gas on, and needs prob $2-3k in parts and labor, BUT that is very reliable and has a lot of utility.<\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m only making around $18\/hr right now, but my credit score is above 700 and I&#39;m trying build credit.

He&#39;s also big on the JDM stuff, so he wants the 90s JDM enthusiast cars, kinda like cars along the lines of what I&#39;ve listed. Pretty much dead set on an Integra, but those are really hard to find on sale and unmolested. My area is full of the tuner\/ricer folk, so everything desirable has been taken up already.

Lease is up in June. I really like the car - it has been perfectly reliable, the power is adequate, it handles well for what it is, and believe it or not, I think it still looks very good. My only peeve with the car is that the infotainment system is dated. It was on the cusp of being dated in 2015, and now it&#39;s really behind the times. I don&#39;t use the navigation much, and the rest of the display stuff is pretty crappy. This has been exacerbated by the 2019 X3 we just got which literally has all the bells and whistles and an awesome tech experience. Would really prefer a coupe. I&#39;ve been leaning towards buying out my lease in June and just keeping this car because it&#39;s treated me well and I like it. Not sure what else is out there that would treat me better. In 2015 I shopped the Lexus, the Audi A5, the BMW 3 Series coupe, the Infiniti G37, and other vehicles in the same class and landed on the Lexus because I loved the style inside and out, and the drive wasn&#39;t that different amongst them all at 5\/10.  I&#39;m perfectly happy buying out my car, but wonder if there&#39;s anything out there that should be piquing my attention.<\/p>\n<\/div>","32":"<div class=\"md\"><ul>\n<li><strong>Location:<\/strong> Los Angeles<\/li>\n<li><strong>Price range:<\/strong> $5000 max (if possible, could go up to $10k if not)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Lease or Buy:<\/strong> Buy<\/li>\n<li><strong>New or used:<\/strong> Used<\/li>\n<li><strong>Type of vehicle:<\/strong> Doesn&#39;t matter<\/li>\n<li><strong>Must haves:<\/strong> Fuel efficient, safe, A\/C<\/li>\n<li><strong>Desired transmission:<\/strong> auto<\/li>\n<li><strong>Intended use:<\/strong> daily driver, 25 miles one way in LA traffic<\/li>\n<li><strong>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered:<\/strong> Nissan Leaf or a Smart Car but I have no idea if those are good choices (can charge at work)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Is this your 1st vehicle:<\/strong> No<\/li>\n<li><strong>Do you need a Warranty:<\/strong> No<\/li>\n<li><strong>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> Ideally no<\/li>\n<li><strong>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> No<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p><strong>Additional Notes:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>I have a CX-5 but it&#39;s going to be used by someone else during the day soon so I need to buy another car to use for my daily commute of 25 miles one way in traffic (about 1 hour each way).

Its 3.5L put out 250hp, so I would want at least that, plus a good amount of aftermarket support\/community\/upgradability so I can make her my own. I&#39;m partial to the Infiniti because it shares parts with the Altima (more reliable) and parts\/engine with a 370z (sporty\/reliable\/aftermarket support).
