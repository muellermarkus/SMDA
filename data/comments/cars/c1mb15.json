Then like a year ago my brother sold them his 2006 Nissan 350z so he could buy a truck. My mom basically told me to take the 350z so that my dad wouldn&#39;t kill himself trying to drive it, and  I was just cool with the idea of basically getting a sports car for way cheaper than it would be to get a junker car.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, now I am actually taking my driving test next week, and made the mistake of driving the Buick today, which made me instantly remember how much I loved the Buick. Being real, the 350z is a much better car, the only thing wrong with it is that it&#39;s left tail light is out, the Buick on the other hand basically had to have an extra $1k of work done to it to get it running how it is now(just have to replace the brakes constantly). My big issue with the Z, is that it feels harder to drive, there are two huge blind spots in the back of the car, and I seriously feel like I would die if I got in an accident.<\/p>\n\n<p>For a first car, what do you think is my best option? I am leaning toward the Buick since I am a college student and expect my first car to not last very long.. Also the more than two seats would be cool since a lot of my friends don&#39;t drive.

However, I have never really been into cars and therefore I\u2019m really unfamiliar with the models and the pros and cons attached to each of the options.

One other feature I\u2019d love would be a system in the car where I can connect my phone and play music as I am a big music fan so I\u2019d like to have the ability to connect my phone to it so I can play my songs. USB connectors would be alright but preferably Bluetooth.
