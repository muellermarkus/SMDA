So, I figure why not wait 4-5 years for the depreciation to set in. Right now, 2018 LC 500s can be had for ~$65k, so I figure within 4-5 years the drop top should hit $45-55k. In the meantime, I can sock away some money every month and just buy a cheap, reliable convertible like a Solara (lol) or SC 430. I don&#39;t drive a ton anyway and who knows when the office opens back up.

I&#39;ve been out of work for a while. I moved to the mountains of Colorado and sold my beloved and reliable Mazdaspeed3 because it couldn&#39;t handle the unplowed roads here. I bought an 06 Jeep Liberty as a cheap snow beater and daily driver and it has been a NIGHTMARE of a vehicle. Just the worst thing I&#39;ve ever owned. BUT... its super amazing in the snow and on the jeep roads out here. Hands down the most capable vehicle I&#39;ve owned when its running and things arent falling off of it.  <\/p>\n\n<p>The moment I get a job I&#39;m shoving it off a cliff and heading to the dealership. I&#39;m between leasing and buying right now, with leasing obviously being a new vehicle and buying being something used. I&#39;ve been looking heavily at the Crosstrek as a replacement, but its dangerously slow and underpowered for climbing these mountain passes. I love that its got high reliability marks. I would consider leasing the Crosstrek Sport, but honestly having driven the Forester with the 2.5L engine...its not much better. Merging into traffic with either of these vehicles feels chancy and climbing hills with 3 bikes and a week&#39;s worth of camping gear seems worse.  <\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m looking for something with the capability of the liberty and the reliability of the subaru and the power of something made this century. The Touareg and Tiguan appeal to me. I looooooved my &#39;06 Rabbit, but I don&#39;t know how they fare offroad and I really want something that can get to my favorite campsites in the national forest near Buena Vista.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<\/div>","52":"<div class=\"md\"><p>How is the reliability\/ease of repairs on the 2013-2015 Jaguar XF Supercharged?
