(Daily drive most likely).<\/p>\n\n<p>Hey so I\u2019m in little of a dilemma thing, so I\u2019ve been thinking now for awhile getting a dope car (im young too tho), anyway for awhile it had been a Nissan GT-R (first it was that vs C63 amg w204, but I decided GT-R) and now I\u2019ve thought a bit about other cars I found to like and mostly now what I\u2019ve seen and everything I like the Mercedes AMG GT model (S\/C\/R) man its so clean too, I\u2019ve thought about the Porsche 911 turbo and GT3 too.<\/p>\n\n<p>But all these are more expensive than the Nissan GT-R and we are getting a really good deal at the Nissan dealership (like really, like 13,000$ USD, I think it converts too that. And we have to buy before 2020, because they\u2019ll raise tax here otherwise too and im not sure if the deal still on). And that\u2019s for a whole new, and yeah these new ones areabit different from the older ones (ik many say it haven\u2019t changed a lot but many people here doesn\u2019t seem to know a lot either lol, they\u2019ve fixed a lot in their latest models tbh, interior better, better daily, more comfortable (specially prestige), fixed clunky, sounds etc. )<\/p>\n\n<p>But lately I\u2019ve started to like this AMG a lot, so its like between these two. And it\u2019s very hard for me. This would be my only car so I would basically daily drive it and use it all around year or when possible, and I\u2019ve read that you can daily drive both. (AMG GT S and C better than the GT R model for that, R for track, and Nissan GT-R good already, newer models). Also I live in Sweden so weather here can get bad\/good.<\/p>\n\n<p>A big plus for me is that the Nissan GT-R have \u201c2 extra seats\u201d in the back actually, feels more practical even tho very small I will use it (friend fam ye). I kind like the look of AMG more. Man it is more expensive tho, not sure that\u2019ll cost me way more, I will not buy a new one tho. So basically 2019\/20 vs 2017.<\/p>\n\n<p>I feel like normal people that don\u2019t know cars would like the Merc more, I mean like girls n stuff idk. Or?<\/p>\n\n<p>First 3 years taxes will be more on the Nissan cuz of new laws here from 2018 and they will even raise 2020, every new car that puts in traffic after that. (Not on Merc cuz I would buy older so it already been used, but Nissan new).<\/p>\n\n<p>Insurance about the same.<\/p>\n\n<p>Would pay more monthly for Merc cuz I won\u2019t pay it all straight cash lol, maybe half.<\/p>\n\n<p>Not sure maintenance which one is more.<\/p>\n\n<p>Y\u2019all know?<\/p>\n\n<p>This is very hard for me, think it\u2019ll be the Nissan mostly because of price and that extra seat. :(<\/p>\n\n<p>Any help and recommendations would be appreciated<\/p>\n<\/div>","36":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[gel\u00f6scht]<\/p>\n<\/div>","37":"<div class=\"md\"><p>In New Jersey and Looking to purchase a new vehicle as a just totaled my 16 Camry I\u2019m looking  an AWD or 4x4 Suv or crossover a 4 cylinder is ok but I would prefer the extra power in a 6 cylinder.
