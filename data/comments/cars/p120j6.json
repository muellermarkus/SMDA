My cousin owns an Evora and I love it. It definitely draws the most looks out of any car I\u2019ve listed. I drove his to LA and when I parked in a lot with a Huracan across the way, people were more interested in taking pics of the Evora than the Huracan.<\/p>\n\n<p>The C7 is the better performer and likely more reliable. I have always driven manual transmission cars, but I wouldn\u2019t mind an automatic. Paddle-shifters seem pretty fun.<\/p>\n\n<p>My hesitation mainly stems from not being sure if I want a C7 for the next 5+ years because it might seem super dated as the C8 continues to appear on public roads near me.<\/p>\n\n<p>The Lotus Elise used to be my dream car for many years. I\u2019d still love one. There is only one listed for sale within 500 miles of me on cargurus, but I wonder if I would get bored driving an Inline-4.

The only issue is that I\u2019d have to go through a bank myself as the dealer near me doesn\u2019t do its own financing. I\u2019ve been told banks generally don\u2019t lend for high end sports car for first time buyers without proof of significant income.
