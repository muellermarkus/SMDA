Ideally, this would be a car I would have for years. I&#39;ve never been too interested in American cars and the Corvette just doesn&#39;t do it for me, which is why I&#39;m not considering it.

Really unsure what to do and will appreciate advice. I currently have a 2002 VW Beetle with 70,000 miles on it. I am the second owner. Since I bought the car, I have replaced almost the entire electric component, certain cooler parts, and fixed 4th cylinder - had to do with ETC issues I think. Not sure. Overall, I put around 3k into a car I bought for 4,5k over the 5 years. I like the car a great deal -- even though it&#39;s not a turbo, it&#39;s super fun to drive, it is bigger than it seems to be but I fit in every tiny parking spot and it&#39;s a unique color, so it stands out. I recently put in on sale for 4,7K because I figured I fixed it enough that nothing should break for a while and I wanted a hybrid for fuel economy, and a car I can take on road trips. What I did not expect, is that my post-ad for it blew up: I have around 10 people after three days of posting that are coming to see the car next week. Am I doing a mistake for selling it and getting a 2009 Prius with 140K miles (both batteries replaced). If it&#39;s a unique color (Luna Green), will it be ever collectible? Or should I raise the price because beside some very minor cosmetic defects, mechanically I fixed the car in every major way? As you can tel;l, I am confused and would like advice!

I enjoyed the Civics and was told they are one of the most reliable brands (although this one is souring me a little) so I wouldn&#39;t mind sticking with them. While looking on the lot the HR-V caught my eye as it had good mileage and space without being as big as the full size SUV. I am open for any suggestions on models and brands outside of Honda as well (have heard good things about Toyota) but am just needing something budget friendly to get me to and from work with space to sleep in or bring camping gear for the few trips into the woods that I make.<\/p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;<\/p>\n\n<p>Thank you for the suggestions<\/p>\n<\/div>","87":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Do you guys think gas cars will actually be banned<\/p>\n<\/div>","88":"<div class=\"md\"><p>The absolute unicorn of Tacomas, a TRD Off-road long box with the leather seats\/sunroof package would basically never depreciate.
