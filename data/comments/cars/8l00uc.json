I&#39;m going to try and drive one later this afternoon, but I&#39;ve ridden in one and seriously enjoyed it! As mentioned I currently drive a 2010 civic sedan. It has more life left in it, but I&#39;m in a position to get a new car and I&#39;d like to get one before I NEED one. Ideally, I&#39;ll wait until the 2019 model years are out and pick up a 2018 for a little cheaper. I haven&#39;t really decided if I need the cargo space of an SUV, but I know I&#39;d like more than my civic so I&#39;m looking at hatchbacks. <\/p>\n\n<p>The Civic Hatch feels like the economic choice. Reliable, cheap, economical, and fuel efficient. I&#39;ve driven a Honda for the last 8 years and I have 2 very reliable dealerships for service and repair in my area, but there are some things that really have rubbed me the wrong way about the car. The paint started to fail after just 4 years despite regular washes and waxes, the chrome bits have started to rub away, the headliner is falling, and it&#39;s plastic as far as the eye can see. I do like the interior of the new hatch, but I hate the exterior and the infotainment borders on distracted driving it&#39;s so bad. The throttle also felt a little sluggish and underpowered. <\/p>\n\n<p>The Mazda3 feels like a good middle ground. It&#39;s more fuel efficient than the VW, has a nicer feeling interior than the Honda and a more usable infotainment, but the car was very loud to drive and the seats were uncomfortable.<\/p>\n\n<p>The VW GTI ticks the most boxes. I&#39;ve wanted one since high school. It was a quiet comfortable drive that was quick and sporty. The infotainment is one of the best and most intuitive I&#39;ve seen. I&#39;m not thrilled about the fuel efficiency, but it&#39;s no worse than my current vehicle. It&#39;s also at the very top of my budget to get all the options I&#39;d like. I know I can shop around and play one dealer off of others since there are about 5 or 6 in my area. The VW also comes with the best warranty of the 3 hatches with 6 years \/ 72,000 miles. The closest dealerships in my area don&#39;t have stellar online reviews, but a colleague has a shop that specializes in German autos that he&#39;s very happy with. <\/p>\n\n<p>As mentioned above, I haven&#39;t decided if I really need the extra cargo space of an SUV, but I&#39;ve looked at the CX-5 and the Crosstrek. I like the CX-5 a little more for the upscale interior, but the dip in fuel efficiency from my current vehicle is kind of a bummer.<\/p>\n\n<p>Since I&#39;m leaning toward the GTI, and I&#39;ve never had a German car before, I wanted to know if <a href=\"\/r\/cars\">r\/cars<\/a> thinks that the reliability issues I&#39;ve always heard about VW&#39;s is a little overblown. I know it&#39;s a performance car and will probably cost more to maintain than a civic, but this will be a vehicle that I need to drive for the next 8-10 years possibly past 100k miles. <\/p>\n\n<p>Tl;dr: Hatch or SUV. Civic, Mazda3, VW GTI. CX-5 or Crosstrek.

Wouldn&#39;t need to be a huge upgrade, but maybe just something different for variety.  That said, the BMW has depreciated to something like 11k-13k CAD, and I&#39;m not sure we&#39;ll find anything that&#39;s even comparable without spending a ton more, which seems like a waste.  (Unless we went for a similar 10ish year old sedan, but then we&#39;re trading a car that we know has been well maintained for one that&#39;s more of a mystery.)
