Between the Mustang and the Camaro, I&#39;m leaning towards the Mustang due to better interior and visibility, and I just prefer the looks of it. I&#39;m looking at both the Ecoboost (mainly because fuel economy and cheaper price, and the easy of getting a bunch of power\/torque with just a tune and a few bolt ons) and V8. <\/p>\n\n<p>I was originally strongly considering a 997 Cayman, but repair\/maintenance costs has pushed it down the list after doing more research. The torque dip on the FRS is really noticeable. Yes, I know you can fix it with header + tune, but why should I have to do when the rest of the choices don&#39;t have this issue.

I want to just have a hobby of buying nice cars that aren&#39;t in perfect condition or ones that constantly need some love, but not salvaged and fixing them up to keeping them running. I want to spend on max ~$60k on the car and see how this hobby goes as I will also need to buy a ramp (can&#39;t fit a lift) and tools.<\/p>\n<\/div>","17":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: Victoria, Australia.
