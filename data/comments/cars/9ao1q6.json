Anything I buy will of course have better tech and safety than what I&#39;m used to now. Our other vehicle is a manual Subaru Forester. We currently live in central PA, but my husband&#39;s job could take us just about anywhere in the continental US next. Husband is trying to convince me to get something &quot;fun&quot; with some zip to it. I want to be mindful to get something that doesn&#39;t have <em>too<\/em> much power, as we live in an area with regular highway coverage by state troopers. I looked at the stats for a WRX STI, but between the low gas mileage and need for premium, it&#39;s definitely out. I&#39;ve started looking into the VW GLI and GTI. We do have a VW dealership in town, so I may go test drive them soon. If Hondas still maintain their reliability, I&#39;d definitely consider another one.

Some of the cars I have considered fall under that plan. For example I could get an rx8 and hope to keep it running stock for a year, and then when the rotary inevitably goes drop a BMW N54 in there.

Buying a cheap warm hatch as a daily and an almost project-y roadster. Therefore having three cars, all of which can be interesting and unreliable :P.

Thankfully VW was also able to work with me for the new car, which I got an incredible deal on for the time (I believe I paid about 23.5k for it - they matched the lowest price I could find in the entire Mid-Atlantic area). I needed a new car at the time based on how much I was driving, but after getting a great new position for a company I see myself at for a long time in center city, I barely use the thing, and the less I use it the more worried I become of people dinging it in the city. Paying full insurance and a car payment each month comes to about $310. I would like to do the following: Sell\/trade my car (getting offers of about 18k for it), buy a used car for between 4-8k that can drive well in winter and has decent cargo space, and pocket the cash that is left over to have funds for repairs and pay down some student loan debt. I currently owe about 6.8k on the car, so going off of the 18k that is being offered, it will net about 11.2k remaining. I have mostly considering &#39;07-&#39;10 Foresters, but would like to see what others are thinking. I would also be dropping down just having liability on the car, so I would save more money for purchasing a home by not having a car payment any more and also paying less in insurance.

Detail (buff, wax, wash, vaccuum), change windshield fluid, add coolant.<br\/>\n<strong>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> No.<br\/>\n<strong>Additional Notes:<\/strong><br\/>\n<strong>Summary:  Need a car which is fairly reliable (survive 3 years outdoors), quiet,  looks decent, and has decent value. Anyone who drives the cars listed,  I&#39;d like to hear your input and experience.<\/strong><br\/>\nI  drive a lot. It&#39;s not uncommon for me to put 300 - 400 km on my car  every week. My driving is 50\/50 city\/highway driving. The cars I&#39;ve  owned are 2006 Suzuki Swift+, 2014 Toyota Corolla, 2013 Audi A4 Premium  Plus Quattro, 2018 Mazda 3 Sport Hatchback. I don&#39;t know if I have  unrealistic expectations, but I know I&#39;m not fussy about the equipment.<br\/>\n1  - Standard equipment (infotainment system, power windows\/locks,  bluetooth, backup camera, AC, heating) is everything I need. I don&#39;t  care for electric seat adjustment, heated seats, 2-zone climate control,  heads up display, leather, extra stitching, etc. I just want to drive  the car in AC while listening to music.<br\/>\n2  - The cabin car must be quiet under 130 km\/hr. Noise isolation is the  most important thing to me when I consider driving for long periods of  time. Whether it&#39;s the engine noise or road noise, quiet please. I&#39;m not  too fussy about suspension, softer is nicer but I understand that sport  cars are stiff and I can live with that.<br\/>\n3  - The car should have sufficient power to make quick maneuvers when  merging onto the freeway. Highway 401 in Ontario can get frisky when not  in traffic. I&#39;d like the car to be nimble in start\/stop situations and  when merging into the fast lane. I don&#39;t care for having the most horse  power, or the highest top speed.<br\/>\n4 -  Value. If the car is a budget car (under 25,000) then I&#39;m open to  keeping it longer. If the car is considered and &quot;luxury&quot; car, then I&#39;d  like to sell it after 3 years.<br\/>\n5 -  Reliability and build quality. I&#39;ve been reassigned to the Ottawa  Valley. There&#39;s 40 cm snowfall, and the roads are heavily salted. I  don&#39;t have access to an in-door garage. I&#39;m stuck in this situation for 3  more years, 2021. I will not be considering a truck.<br\/>\n6 - I want a good looking car for my own vanity. There&#39;s no one to impress out here, so I don&#39;t mind driving a budget car.<br\/>\n7  -   I am considering a coupe (first time) because I drive on my own. On  some occasion (30-50 times a year) I will drive 2-3 friends. Once a  year I&#39;ll put something large in my car (desk chair, ikea desk). I am  willing to pay for delivery for these things.<br\/>\n8  - I like the idea of a budget car if it&#39;s everything but powerful. The  problem with the budget cars is that they might not last in the harsh  winters, and are usually quite loud. My 2018 Mazda 3 sounds quite loud  when I get to 2500 RPM, and still doesn&#39;t get up to speed in what I&#39;d  consider quickly. The 2013 Audi A4 cruises well at 100-130 km\/hr sitting  at 2000-2200 RPM. It&#39;s quite quiet and has enough power 211 HP to do  what I want, but the car itself was expensive for what I received.  Anemic power compared to other similarly priced luxury German vehicles,  not as prestigious or luxurious (plastic wood panels), considering it  was a top trim, top spec, top everything model, I felt that it wasn&#39;t  worth. The 2014 Corolla was a treat to drive except that it was grossly  under powered. Well equipped, well styled, reliable, cheap to maintain. I  don&#39;t want to drive this car again because I&#39;d like to experience other  brands.<br\/>\n9 - I understand that the coupes  listed are basically the same as their sedan counterparts  (mechanically). I see on the used market, that they are relatively close  in price compared to their markup when new. If I&#39;m getting the same  driver experience from these coupes, I&#39;d rather just take the sedan.<br\/>\nThanks for the help.<\/p>\n<\/div>","7":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: Baltimore<\/p>\n\n<p>Price range: &lt;$25,000<\/p>\n\n<p>Lease or Buy: Buy<\/p>\n\n<p>New or used: Used<\/p>\n\n<p>Type of vehicle: Sedan or hatchback<\/p>\n\n<p>Must haves: My biggest items so far is reliability and gas mileage.

Currently had to open the cylinder head and there&#39;s a lot of issues with it right now, but I won&#39;t delve into it. For context, that car has been with us for 17 years and my dad and older brother used it before me. When it broke down for the nth time this year, my dad and I both realized that maybe, despite our attachment to it, it would be better to get another car. The problem we have is there are about 50 Eclipses in our country and parts are hard to get. Now, we&#39;ve been thinking what to get if we were to really sell it, and I fell in love with the idea of owning a Miata. We used to own one but had to sell it because there was an issue with the papers due to it being an import, instead of the local ones here. I&#39;m pretty sure that Miata parts are way easier to get here, and there&#39;s a much bigger community of Miata owners here. Do you think the Eclipse would be worth selling to get a Miata?

Trunk space is not an issue with me, nor are the two seats. Will probably miss the stage 1 build 300hp of the eclipse, but my dad said that, with how light the Miata is, it&#39;ll go really fast despite the 120hp, and I can build it as a project car anyway.<\/p>\n<\/div>","46":"<div class=\"md\"><p><strong>Location:<\/strong> Northern California<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Price range:<\/strong> $3k-$10k<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Lease or Buy:<\/strong> Buy<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>New or used:<\/strong>  Used<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Type of vehicle:<\/strong> Wagon<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Must haves:<\/strong> AWD\/ snow capable, comfortable, and I don&#39;t hate myself driving it.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc):<\/strong> Manual<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Intended use:<\/strong> Hauling around stuff, going on snow trips and camping trips, taking friends to the bar, and being my most comfortable and spacious car<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered:<\/strong>  E46 325xit, Volvo V70R, Audi avant, E91\/E61 It would be replacing my Outback XT which is too finicky of a car and does not handle well.
