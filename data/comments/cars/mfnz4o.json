I have dreamt of road racing on weekends since I can remember. Now, it can be a reality for the first time in my life. If i did all the work myself, sure, but I live in an apartment where working on my car is banned. This is where things get difficult. I also have life goals which require I spend as little as possible. I know, road racing isn&#39;t budget friendly, but hear me out - I could get a C6 base and just drive it with upgraded stickies and brakes. If I do frequent maintenance and try to keep it from always being in high RPMs, it might last. Or, a Miata. I don&#39;t need to be the fastest kid on the block; I just want to go fast around a track as a hobby. Miatas are too small so they are a hard pass. But, the idea of a Miata works really well for what I&#39;m trying to do. Another option is a Civic, but I really, really think RWD or AWD are the only options for true sports cars. So, what what I left with? I&#39;ve even considered some of the 40k C7 Vettes out here after trading in my car. My ideal car would be an Evo with bigger displacement and the interior and luxuries of a C7 which would pay dividends during a trip to the beach or somewhere else. I know you can&#39;t have your cake and eat it to, so I&#39;m willing to compromise. At the end of the day, I just want something cheap to take on the track. Let me know what&#39;s realistic. Not sure if relevant, but 10 years later, the Evo 8 is still the best car and driving experience I&#39;ve ever had. It&#39;s just now, the interior is dated imo (still love it though) and the car is expensive - but, it&#39;s still one of my top options because it just sticks around the corners. I&#39;m thinking maybe look around for an pre-built C5, but they&#39;re so hard to find. The last one slipped out from under me... thanks for reading!<\/p>\n<\/div>","83":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: England <\/p>\n\n<p>Price Range: Anything up to 5K <\/p>\n\n<p>Lease or Buy: Bye <\/p>\n\n<p>New or Used: New <\/p>\n\n<p>Type of Vehicle: No preference <\/p>\n\n<p>Must Haves: Under 10 seconds 0-60, no older than 10 years. <\/p>\n\n<p>Desired Transmission: Manual <\/p>\n\n<p>Intended use: Daily commute to work <\/p>\n\n<p>Vehicles considered: Suzuki Swift, Seat Ibiza <\/p>\n\n<p>Is this your first vehicle: No <\/p>\n\n<p>Do you need a warranty: No <\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do minor work on your own vehicle: No <\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do major work on your own vehicle: No<\/p>\n\n<p>Additional notes: I\u2019ve already got a car, Focus RS.

Are the vehicles you listed as having considered ruled out or still in consideration? They don&#39;t give me a good idea of what you&#39;re looking for given that they span front engine, mid engine, rear engine, RWD, AWD, American, German, Italian, Japanese, V8, V10, H6, NA, turbocharged, supercharged, coupe-only, and convertible-only.<\/p>\n\n<p>The one constant I see, though, is that these are all new\/er touring cars. So is it fair to say that you want something comfortable, fun, fast, decently luxurious\/featured, with enough space for a weekend trip (and not necessarily in that order)?<\/p>\n\n<p>$150k is going to struggle to get you a solid &quot;no stories&quot; example of any newer Ferrari or Lamborghini aside from the Cali T (although if I definitely wanted a convertible GT that would be a hard one to pass up). Bump to $200k and you&#39;ll have some options here.<\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;d personally pass on the GTR given how long in the teeth it&#39;s become and the NSX just doesn&#39;t seem to have that much appeal (to my or, really, anyone). C8 and GT500 are obviously great cars well within your price range. Do you want American muscle? Seems like a pretty cut and dry decision there.<\/p>\n\n<p>The Porsche range is pretty wide at $150k. You&#39;re talking everything from 911 Turbo to GT3\/4 to 718 GTS 4.0. What&#39;re you thinking re: 911?<\/p>\n\n<p>What about an AMG GT? As far as I recall, the GT-S should be within that price range. They&#39;re pretty different from most things on the road, have a bit of &quot;exotic-ness&quot; to them, are fairly comfortable, certainly perform well, etc.<\/p>\n\n<p>Are things like the M8 Competition or AMG S-Class too mundane?<\/p>\n\n<p>The MP4-12C is definitely within your budget, although the maintenance is going to cost 10s of thousands whether paid directly or through a renew-by-year warranty. There are also 570Ss out there to had for under $150k, but I&#39;m not sure that is any better of a prospect from a cost-of-ownernship perspective. All of the cars you&#39;ve listed above are in a completely different class as far as reliability and cost of ownership, so maybe this is also a consideration?<\/p>\n<\/div>","88":"<div class=\"md\"><p>What about a used McLaren 570? I mean, if reliability isn&#39;t super high up on your list of must-haves and it&#39;s considered one of their more-reliable models, it&#39;s not a bad option.<\/p>\n<\/div>","89":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I vote for the nsx<\/p>\n<\/div>","90":"<div class=\"md\"><p>For a first car with a budget of $3k, please avoid leasing (or financing). Find something in decent shape that will be cheap to keep on the road and, like you say, drive it until the wheels fall off.<\/p>\n\n<p>Corolla\/Civic is a good starting point. Avoid that $2999 Mini you&#39;ve been eyeing. The Yaris used to start &lt; $10k brand new, if memory serves, so that might something worth looking into.<\/p>\n\n<p>Outside of the obvious choices? Hmm. Maybe an older (pre-CVT) Subaru?<\/p>\n<\/div>","91":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Actually, North American Mazda 3 and CX-30 models are all made at the Mazda plant in Mexico. As far as I know, that&#39;s been the case since the redesigned Mazda 3 came out in 2019. Given their similarities in terms of parts, powertrains, platforms, etc, it&#39;s likely that they&#39;ll have very similar long-term reliability.<\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;d pick whichever one you like better! I&#39;d go 3, since you can get the Grand Touring hatchback with a manual transmission in the US. Not sure about Canada.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit:<\/strong> If you&#39;d like to confirm this, you can look at the VIN number of a new Mazda 3 and a new CX-30. If it&#39;s built in Japan, the first character will be J. If it&#39;s built in Mexico, the first character will be 3.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit 2:<\/strong> It looks like North American Mazda 3 models are split between being built in Mexico and Japan. TIL!<\/p>\n<\/div>","92":"<div class=\"md\"><p>That&#39;s interesting, though again, in the US every indication seems to point to both vehicles coming from the Mexico plant, so I&#39;m not sure if Dr. Goose&#39;s panel gaps could be attributed to that. I can&#39;t remember the details of that video, though I&#39;m sure I watched it, so may he did mention that they were from different factories. Which would make me even more confused.<\/p>\n\n<p>But all this is besides the point: Conventional wisdom would point to &quot;Built in Japan&quot; being a more desirable thing to see than &quot;Built in Mexico.&quot; But I&#39;m not sure if the data follows. When we hear anecdotal stories of one brand moving manufacturing from one location to another and how awful it was, there are a ton of possible explanations, from deciding to use parts that are cheaper to produce and more prone to breaking, to electronics that aren&#39;t assembled at the plants in question. The only good way to know is to look at the data. In this case, Mazda 3 models sold in the US have been built there since 2014, and reliability has been excellent so far, according to Consumer Reports. Same story with the Mazda 2 and all its various rebadges: the Scion iA and Yaris iA have both been more reliable than your average car at that price point, despite being built to such a low price point, both put together at the Mexico plant.<\/p>\n\n<p>I really wouldn&#39;t worry about it. Pick the one you like best. The data is on your side either way.<\/p>\n<\/div>","93":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Subaru Crosstrek seems right up your alley.
