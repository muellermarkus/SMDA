The practicality of the CX-9 is intriguing but I&#39;m not sure it would satisfy my desire to have a little fun when the kids aren&#39;t with me. Our other vehicle is a Toyota Sienna minivan so a real family truckster isn&#39;t needed.

My first choice was to save up for a low trim R32 Skyline but maybe a RHD 25yo import with little to no parts available isn&#39;t the best first car. I&#39;ve looked at 240SX and similar cars, but I&#39;m still not sure what would be good for me. I&#39;m from Quebec, so the roads aren&#39;t the best and snow is a big thing.

I\u2019m a female in my 30s who doesn\u2019t want kids and has always enjoyed car culture. The RX8 I had was fun to drive, but it didn\u2019t quite pick up as quick off the line as I wanted it to. I know the rotary shines when you get to higher rpms, I just don\u2019t know if that\u2019s what I want this time. The handling on winding roads was a blast and definitely made up for that though. The car itself had major electrical problems (which they\u2019re known for - i know) and had been reworked for nitrous so it got more complicated than I wanted. I\u2019m looking for something fast, fun, and relatively simple to mod - like racing clutch, gears, intake, etc. I will also say I absolutely loved the Bose sound system in the RX8.<\/p>\n<\/div>","8":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Location:<\/strong> Miami  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Price range: $0 - $5000<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Lease or Buy:<\/strong> buy  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>New or used: used<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Type of vehicle:<\/strong> Coupe,Sport Car, Tuner cars  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Must haves:<\/strong> Leather, reliable   <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc):<\/strong> either  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Intended use:<\/strong> Daily diver, weekend car  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered:<\/strong> Acura Tl (3rd gen), Mercedes E190,   <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Is this your 1st vehicle: yep :)<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you need a Warranty:<\/strong> No  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> Yes  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> No  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Additional Notes:<\/strong> it has to be cool looking and a large aftermarket<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<\/div>","9":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: Toronto, Canada<\/p>\n\n<p>Price range: 25,000 - 40, 000<\/p>\n\n<p>Lease or Buy: buy<\/p>\n\n<p>New or used: new<\/p>\n\n<p>Type of vehicle: (compact SUV or mid size SUV.)<\/p>\n\n<p>Must haves: (AWD, Fuel efficient***)<\/p>\n\n<p>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc): auto<\/p>\n\n<p>Intended use: (Daily Driver.)<\/p>\n\n<p>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: Mazda cx5, Kia sportage, Nissan rogue<\/p>\n\n<p>Is this your 1st vehicle: no<\/p>\n\n<p>Do you need a Warranty: it would be nice<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle: (fluids, alternator, battery, brake pads etc) yes<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle: (engine and transmission, timing belt\/chains, body work, suspension etc ) not so much<\/p>\n\n<p>Additional Notes: driving 200km per day for work (120 miles) 5 days a week so I need something that won&#39;t completely kill me on gas and is decent highway driving.

(Don&#39;t have kids yet, but that might change soon). Accord is much more spacious on the back, which is surprising as they are almost same length.<\/p>\n\n<p>- Exterior styling - I don&#39;t really like Accord&#39;s exterior styling and love Mazda6&#39;s looks. Also, Mazdas are not as common as Honda.<\/p>\n\n<p>- Infotainment - Accord is better. (I haven&#39;t really used either but from reviews, it looks like Accord wins here.) Good thing is both have Android Auto now.<\/p>\n\n<p>- Interior styling - I like Mazda 6 better but Accord is pretty good. Accord also has lot more storage.<\/p>\n\n<p>- Features - I&#39;d love to have HUD and so I&#39;m opting for Touring but Touring also comes with 360 camera\/sensors with Mazda6 GTR does not have.<\/p>\n\n<p>- Model refresh - Honda is completely refreshed for 2018 which means for next 5-6 years, I can expect my car to not get outdated whereas Mazda6 might get a refresh sooner.<\/p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;<\/p>\n\n<p>The MSRP price difference between the two is around 3000.

I am looking for a fuel efficient car, and trying to find the sweet spot between old car and not too much mechanics trouble. Wife prefers a car on the small side (4 doors required with the baby). Will probably be driving 5k miles\/year max. So a 2014 car with 40-70k miles would probably be something I am looking at. Also not sure if i should buy from a private party vs. dealership. At the moment, I am eyeing this car: <a href=\"https:\/\/boston.craigslist.org\/gbs\/ctd\/d\/2014-toyota-prius\/6742101939.html\">https:\/\/boston.craigslist.org\/gbs\/ctd\/d\/2014-toyota-prius\/6742101939.html<\/a><\/p>\n<\/div>","72":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>Location: Philadelphia area   <\/p>\n\n<p>Price range: $4000 - $18000  <\/p>\n\n<p>Lease or Buy: Buy  <\/p>\n\n<p>New or used: Used or new   <\/p>\n\n<p>Type of vehicle: Prefer a car that can manage the snow (or can most new cars manage the snow just fine??)   <\/p>\n\n<p>Must haves: Rear camera   <\/p>\n\n<p>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc): auto  <\/p>\n\n<p>Intended use:  Daily commuter car   <\/p>\n\n<p>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: I know nothing about cars, just want something reliable with low maintenance  <\/p>\n\n<p>Is this your 1st vehicle: no  <\/p>\n\n<p>Do you need a Warranty: Yes   <\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle: No :(   <\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle: No :(   <\/p>\n\n<p>My current car (2005 honda accord) is a complete dud in the snow right now, so am looking to buy fairly soon.

With a remaining loan of $132k after 6 months, if I am able to sell the Ferrari for $176k (seems within reason)- then I will have essentially driven the car for 6 months for free.<\/p>\n\n<p>As long as I get a good deal upon purchase and am able to get a deal upon selling, it should work. I can then drive a Lamborghini or whatever and so on. Even if this technique ended up costing me $10k every 6 months, I feel like it would be worth it. Thoughts? Does this actually work?<\/p>\n\n<p>My breakdown below: <a href=\"https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/Hiqqf1w\">https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/Hiqqf1w<\/a><\/p>\n<\/div>","114":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Nice<\/p>\n<\/div>","115":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Backstory: I got a Mitsubishi Lancer Ralliart 2009 but found it drank a LOT of gas.
