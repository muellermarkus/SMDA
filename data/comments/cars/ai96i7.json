years old. When I say new car and a couple years old, it&#39;s a vehicle that&#39;s sat on the dealers lot for a couple years and has not been sold. He stated to make sure the warranty hasn&#39;t bee activated and it may be possible to buy the car even cheaper than its listed since its sat so long.<\/p>\n\n<p>I found a 2015 Mustang GT Premium with 10 miles sitting at at Ford dealer. MSRP is stated as 44k and they have it discounted to 34k. The dealer this is at deals mostly with trucks since it&#39;s in a rural area and most people work on oil\/gas rigs.<\/p>\n\n<p>Does anyone here have experience with this or advice on how to go about this? I was going to stop by on Tuesday and ask about it. This may be the first vehicle I&#39;ve bought from a dealer if there&#39;s a chance at a great deal. <\/p>\n<\/div>","1":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: USA<\/p>\n\n<p>Price Range: ~80,000 Max<\/p>\n\n<p>Lease or Buy: Buy<\/p>\n\n<p>New or Used: New<\/p>\n\n<p>Type of Vehicle: Mid-Size SUV<\/p>\n\n<p>Must Haves: Nice Styling\/Presence, Luxury, Comfortable Ride Quality<\/p>\n\n<p>Nice to Have: Enough power and confident handling to comfortably move up and down curvy mountain roads (20 - 40mph kinda&#39; roads)<\/p>\n\n<p>Desired Transmission: Automatic<\/p>\n\n<p>Intended Use: Daily Driver, Family Car<\/p>\n\n<p>Vehicles Considered\/Considering: RR Sport, RR Velar, Porsche Cayenne, BMW X5<\/p>\n\n<p>First Vehicle: No, already own a 2016 Audi A5<\/p>\n\n<p>Warranty: Buying New<\/p>\n\n<p>Minor Work: No<\/p>\n\n<p>Major Work: No<\/p>\n\n<p>Additional Notes: Ideally, I&#39;d like to keep the car for 4 or 5 years, and will probably put on 40,000 to 50,000 miles in that time (since I already have a second car I&#39;ll be using too).<\/p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;<\/p>\n<\/div>","2":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Location:<\/strong> Wilmington, Ohio  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Price range:<\/strong> 15-26k (this is flexible)   <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Lease or Buy: Buy<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>New or used: Ideally new, but will consider lightly used<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Type of vehicle:<\/strong> Hot hatch, Sports  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Must haves:<\/strong> FUN, reliable and easy to service,  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc): Manual<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Intended use:  Daily, this will be my only car<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: Fiesta ST, BRZ(86 twin) , Veloster N (I feel like car will be limited and severely marked up), Golf GTI<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Is this your 1st vehicle: No<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you need a Warranty: Yes<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> Yes  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> No  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Additional Notes: Moving out is on the horizon so I am looking for cheap, reliable fun!

I have been planning on buying a 2015 BMW 335i for about 6 months now. My wife and I have been sharing a car because she takes public transportation to work, but we will be moving across the country in about 6 weeks and she will be starting a new job which will require us both to have a car. The problem I am having is that from what I have seen, the market for 2015 335i&#39;s is not exactly robust in the Louisville, Kentucky area from what I can see online. What I am looking for is rather specific, a low miles, very good condition version with the M Sport package and I am fearful that once we get out to Louisville (we are in Phoenix, AZ now) I am going to have a very difficult time finding what I am looking for.<\/p>\n\n<p>I have actually found and test-driven pretty much the perfect version of this car out here in Phoenix, but that would mean buying it in AZ and either having it shipped out to Kentucky or driving it across country, which seems like a pain but in the end probably worth it to make sure I get what I want. Anyone have any thoughts one way or the other?<\/p>\n<\/div>","11":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Location:<\/strong> Southern California, USA  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Price range:<\/strong> up to $3000  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Lease or Buy:<\/strong>  Buy  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>New or used:<\/strong> Used  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Type of vehicle:<\/strong> Car  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Must haves:<\/strong> Fun to drive, Manual, 4 seats (don&#39;t need 4 doors, just dog room,) not the most unreliable thing ever.    <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc):<\/strong> Manual  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Intended use:<\/strong> Basic Transportation to use when I don&#39;t want to drive my huge gas pig around.  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered:<\/strong> Honda Prelude, SN95 Mustang, RSX, Q45  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Is this your 1st vehicle:<\/strong> Very much no  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you need a Warranty:<\/strong> No  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> Yes, and I will do everything myself  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> Yes, but I don&#39;t wanna.   <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Additional Notes:<\/strong> I&#39;m stuck wondering if I am missing a good option, something I am over-looking that is way cooler than a mustang and more fun than a civic. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<\/div>","12":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Location:<\/strong> Orlando, FL, USA  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Price range:<\/strong> Max of $10,000  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Lease or Buy:<\/strong> Buy  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>New or used:<\/strong> Used preffered for low mileage but can do new  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Type of vehicle:<\/strong> Coupe, Sedan  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Must haves:<\/strong> Fuel efficient, Bluetooth, maybe rearview cam, A\/C  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc):<\/strong> Auto  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Intended use:<\/strong> Daily Driver, Work and School Commuter   <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered:<\/strong> Civic, Camry, Corolla, Altima, Sentra  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Is this your 1st vehicle: Yes<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you need a Warranty: No<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> No  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> No  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Additional Notes:<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p>Been sharing a car with my S\/O for a few months, now it&#39;s time to get one of my own since I have my own responsibilities to take care of.

I own a couple of BMWs, and while reliable enough, the newest one is a 2001. It seems like at any one time they&#39;ve each got *something* that needs addressing, though it&#39;s usually small things that are inexpensive to fix, but I&#39;d really like to pick up something that I could both daily, and use when I need to travel without feeling like i need to go over every little detail before getting on the road.  <\/p>\n\n<p>One challenge that I face is that I&#39;m cheap, and the idea of a depreciating asset, really makes me upset. One of the benefits of the cars I have now is that they have not only bottomed out from a depreciation standpoint, they are somewhat niche cars with a fairly dedicated following. So when letting them go, I expect to (almost) break even.   <\/p>\n\n<p>My tastes run to sportier cars, and I was convinced that the 2014 BMW 550i was the perfect mix of value and performance, until every time I turn around, there seems to be some new problem with the N63. While I do all of my own work, the sort of issues being reported sort of turned me off. That of course, and the fact that with it not being an M car, the depreciation is just going to keep going.  <\/p>\n\n<p>I then started looking into the various Lexus models, and have sort of gone back and forth between something like a 2010 LS460, and a 2016 GS-F. My thinking was the LS460 represented the best value (since it appears to already be bottomed out value wise) and it would be sort of nice to have a &quot;luxury&quot; car. Alternatively, the GS-F represents (what on paper) appears to be an excellent replacement for my M5. The downside here is that currently it&#39;s price seems to be in the upper 40s to 50s. If it behaves like the IS-F did, that would be a little more palatable, to my stingy tastes, but I don&#39;t know if there is any guarantee of that.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Of course my uncertainty there led to my interest in the BMW 340\/440. Great motor, newer car, I&#39;m familiar with the marquee,etc. Greater depreciation overall, but initial outlay is lower as well. The problem I have is that I start looking and I keep bumping my &quot;price&quot; closer and closer to what the GS-F starts dipping into.  <\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m mostly looking for any other options that I may not have thought of, or any other thoughts or advice.

I&#39;ve looked at Honda Elements forever, but in CO they sell for a premium, even with crazy high miles. Even then, I&#39;ve test driven one, and found myself a little cramped in the front seat. Living in a city though, space can be a premium, and I would rather not drive a huge gas guzzler like an older Ford Expedition.<\/p>\n\n<p>Other than the element, there doesn&#39;t seem to be anything I can find that has reat seats that fold COMPLETELY flat. The CRV would be perfect if not for the fact that it&#39;s got a slight angle when you lean the seats forward all the way. As far as I can tell, the Rav4 suffers from the same problem. There are times when it&#39;s raining or I have the dog with me, and I would rather just camp in the back of the vehicle instead of setting up a tent.

I don&#39;t really need much, but my current car, a 2005 suzuki verona, just doesn&#39;t cut it for the outdoors. <\/p>\n\n<p>The truth is, I can find Honda Elements with 200k+ miles from 2003 for around my budget. but would it be worth it at that point?
