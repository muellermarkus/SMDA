Kicking back and forth between the idea of a one-car and two-car garage, I finally settled on the idea of having just one car.  I want 4 doors, or usable rear seats at an absolute minimum.  Considering alternatives to the SS, I test drove a 2011 Audi S4 and pretty much immediately fell in love with the car, but after doing further research I learned that the 2013+ models are better.  From the research I&#39;ve done, the B8.5 S4 with a manual transmission is pretty much the most reliable and affordable Audi performance car there is.  I understand it will cost more than an SS\/G8 to maintain, but I can live with that.<\/p>\n\n<p>Basically I&#39;m sold on getting a 2013-2016 Audi S4 with a budget of $21000-$25000, but I&#39;m willing to hear people out on other stuff I&#39;d like.  <\/p>\n<\/div>","2":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Is this car worth buying?<\/p>\n\n<p>The car has been sitting since at least 9\/16, it&#39;s on private property.

If I can flip it as is, what might it be worth. Is there a market for this kinda thing or is parting it out a better option?

My friend is selling the mazda 3 for $4k, and he has detailed records of the work he&#39;s done on it. It has a new battery and brakepads. The tires are new-ish; they&#39;re a couple years and 5000 miles old. I&#39;ve given it a test drive and I have no complaints. So this seems like a pretty safe bet to me  <\/p>\n\n<p>The subaru is quite attractive, but I&#39;m worried it might be risky. It has a rebuilt title, for one. Also when I took it for a test drive, there was a warning to &quot;check the hybrid system&quot; the first time I turned it on. It went away when I turned the engine off and turned it back on though. The test drive was great---my one complaint is that it didn&#39;t accelerate super well, but that seems to be par for the course for subarus. I&#39;ve already had a mechanic do an inspection and they said it was in great condition---no sign of flood damage, the frame is good, wheels are aligned, brake pads are new, and all that. Also, I talked to a Subaru dealer who said I could still drive the car even if the hybrid system is completely dead, and I don&#39;t care so much for the extra 5mpg in the city.   <\/p>\n\n<p>The main benefits of the subaru are that it already has a trailer hitch and roof rack installed (which will be nice for carrying bikes\/kayaks\/etc), it&#39;s roomier (which will make it easier to move across the country), and it has better clearance. My main concerns are that it might need major repairs in the future (I hear subarus are not very reliable) and also about its resale value (I&#39;m not sure how long I&#39;ll have this car---maybe 2 years?)   <\/p>\n\n<p>So basically, I think the Subaru would make me a lot happier assuming nothing major breaks.

So last comment was a toss-up between the Audi S4 and Chevy SS.  I can now proudly say that I&#39;ve widened my search to include even more cars.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Background: Currently drive a G8.  Want to downsize to only driving one car at a time.  So either one car or two seasonal cars.  I commute about 40 miles per day round-trip and hope to shorten that by either relocating or changing jobs in the next year.<\/p>\n\n<p>Budget: Figure I can get about $14000 out of.  Sold Miata for $7500.  Probably another $1000 in accessories to sell so that leaves me at $22500 before even touching my savings.<\/p>\n\n<p>Insurance costs: Am 24 with clean record in the Midwest.  Used to insure a G8 year-round plus a Miata for 7 months, so I can handle a mildly expensive car to insure.<\/p>\n\n<p>Requirements: Sedan (Or coupe with usable rear seats), manual, RWD or AWD<\/p>\n\n<p>Cars I won&#39;t consider: WRX, Evo, Focus RS, Golf R<\/p>\n\n<p>Cars I&#39;m considering: Acura TL, Cadillac CTS-V, Chevy SS, Audi S4, Cadillac ATS 2.0T<\/p>\n\n<p>Cars I&#39;ll entertain: BMW 335i, BMW 540i, Cadillac CTS-V coupe<\/p>\n\n<p>The Audi S4 seems like a great all-rounder, but the B8.5 generation is $20k minimum and not even close to being done with depreciation.<\/p>\n\n<p>The Cadillac ATS and Acura TL seem like the most economical options.  They can be had for under $15k easily and get great fuel economy, but the TL is slow and the ATS is slow without bolt-ons.<\/p>\n\n<p>The Chevy SS literally won&#39;t depreciate, so that&#39;s a plus.  After daily driving my G8 for a year I wouldn&#39;t mind mixing things up.  This is also the most expensive car and will require a winter car.<\/p>\n\n<p>The CTS-V is where I&#39;m currently leaning.  It&#39;s cheaper than the SS, the interior seems nicer, that moonroof is sexy as hell, and it can be had for around $25k.  I&#39;d need a winter car as well.  This car somehow gets worse mileage than my G8 and an SS.  I&#39;ve never test driven one of these and have no idea how I&#39;d go about doing that since finding a local one at a dealer that will let a 24-year-old near it sounds impossible.<\/p>\n\n<p>Yeah I&#39;m indecisive as fuck.  I&#39;m leaning toward the idea of a CTS-V then a B8 Audi A4 Quattro for winter.  The depreciation of the CTS-V has me worried though.  As a manual sedan with 500+ hp, I have a hard time believing prices will drop much more than they already have.  But you never know.<\/p>\n<\/div>","60":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Location:<\/strong> California  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Price range:<\/strong> 32k max  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Lease or Buy: Buy<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>New or used: New<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Type of vehicle:<\/strong> Midsize truck  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Must haves:<\/strong> V6, Push to start, Apple carplay pref  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc): Automatic<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Intended use:<\/strong> Daily Driver, weekend warrior  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: Tacoma &amp; Colorado<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Is this your 1st vehicle: No<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you need a Warranty: Yes, would be nice<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> Yes  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> No<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<\/div>","61":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Thinking about getting a local Toyota Pickup.

I looked at the at the Porsche Macan but I personally find the seats to be wildly uncomfortable.  I&#39;ve scoured all the luxury brands I can think of and all the SUVs are dull and boring to drive, even the ones with lots of HP. Are there any SUVs out there that are fun to drive at all?<\/p>\n\n<p>Given that I can&#39;t find what I want in a luxury brand I decided if I&#39;m going to compromise I might as well get a cheaper compromise. So I looked at Ford, Honda, Mazda, and Hyundai. Ford doesn&#39;t make cars\/hatchbacks anymore. The new 2019 Mazda hatch cargo volume is very small for a hatch and the lip of the hatch is so high it entirely defeats the purpose of getting a hatch, plus while the car handles well it feels under powered and there&#39;s no cooled seats only heated. The Civic is less fun to drive but it does have more cargo room.<\/p>\n\n<p>The Hyundai is shorter than the Mazda or Civic which I like because it will be easier for me to park in the city and it has more HP, more cargo room, and ventilated seats. In fact the only thing I&#39;m giving up in the Elantra compared to some of the luxury cars I&#39;m looking at is 3D parking camera (and performance when compared to the Porsche but the performance is better than every other Luxury SUV I&#39;ve tried.)<\/p>\n\n<p>Is there anything else at all I should consider?

I have a bit of savings built up and am looking into financing to build credit. If I were to buy a car outright, I would be willing to spend $12-13k. Through Geico&#39;s car buying program, I received an offer for a new 2019 Kia Forte for a little over $16k. This offer is tempting but I am thinking that maybe I should buy a slightly used car in order to spend less money. I am interested in Hyundai and Kias because from what I have researched these Korean companies have drastically improved the quality of their cars while maintaining affordability. They also seem to have really good warranties. I value reliability and comfort, and I really like the technology in these newer cars. I would also like a car that gets good gas mileage, which is why I am also looking into hybrids and EVs. I am a pretty average person when it comes to cars so I am willing to sacrifice some performance for efficiency.<\/p>\n\n<p>Any and all help is appreciated!

I don&#39;t mind a road trip from a neighboring state, but the truck would have to be able to make that journey.<\/p>\n<\/div>","105":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: nyc - or 200 miles around<\/p>\n\n<p>Price range: $2k max<\/p>\n\n<p>Lease or Buy: buy<\/p>\n\n<p>New or used: used<\/p>\n\n<p>Type of vehicle: sedan or 2 door<\/p>\n\n<p>Must haves: RWD<\/p>\n\n<p>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc): open, stick preferred <\/p>\n\n<p>Intended use: weekend car<\/p>\n\n<p>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: bmw 3 series, lexus gs, jeep Cherokee, Porsche 944<\/p>\n\n<p>Is this your 1st vehicle: no<\/p>\n\n<p>Do you need a Warranty: no<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle: yes<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle: no<\/p>\n<\/div>","106":"<div class=\"md\"><p><strong>Location:<\/strong> Midwest USA<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Price range:<\/strong> $20,000 - $35,000<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Lease or Buy:<\/strong> Buy<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>New or used:<\/strong> Either<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Type of vehicle:<\/strong> Midsize SUV or Truck (not a small crossover)<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Must haves:<\/strong> Fuel efficient, trunk space, upscale &amp; quiet interior, capable in the snow, Apple CarPlay, modest towing abilities<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc):<\/strong> Either<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Intended use:<\/strong> Daily Driver and Weekend Family Car<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered:<\/strong> Toyota 4 Runner, Mazda CX-9, Honda Pilot, Toyota Tacoma, Chevy Colorado<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Is this your 1st vehicle:<\/strong> No<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you need a Warranty:<\/strong> Not necessarily<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> Sure<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> No<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Additional Notes:<\/strong>  I\u2019m looking to replace my old GMC truck for my daily commute.

I want something that&#39;s under 50k miles, and hopefully has some warranty left just in case I buy a bad example. My daily commute will be 60 miles with 0 traffic, so I want something that has good hwy MPG and is comfortable to sit in. Would take the Stinger, but I&#39;m aiming to keep the mileage low in case I need to sell it, and commuting that far with 26mpg on premium is significantly more expensive than buying a different car.
