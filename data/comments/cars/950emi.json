I only drive during the summers until I graduate, and I&#39;m wondering whether I should get a new car now, when my current car still has some trade in value, or in two years when I have more cash saved up but my current car will probably be worthless.

Potentially willing to fly in anywhere in the Western US and take a road trip back home if the price is good enough.<\/p>\n\n<p>Price range: (Minimum-Maximum in your local currency) preferably under 6k, but I can stretch to 8k.

Must be 2009 or later, and under 100k miles (these are my parents&#39; requirements). Must be American. Ideally I&#39;d prefer something that feels less clunky of a drive than my current car, but that may not be possible given my other requirements. I&#39;ll be using this both as a daily driver, and for lots of road trips, ski trips, and camping trips.<\/p>\n\n<p>Maybe willing to consider a crossover if it doesn&#39;t look like an amorphous blob or overgrown sedan.

Ideally above 20. Needs lots of legroom (I&#39;m 6&#39;2). Needs to be big enough to sleep in. AWD is a must. Navigation is a must, and backup camera is almost a must. I don&#39;t want any of the fancy lane keeping\/blind spot\/adaptive cruise control\/assisted parking semiautomated stuff, but I can&#39;t imagine any of those will be in my price range anyway. After years of driving a very large car with a V6, I strongly prefer a V8. CD player is a must, but I expect any car old enough to be cheap enough will definitely have this. Needs to have racks on top or be able to easily and cheaply have them installed.<\/p>\n\n<p>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc): automatic.<\/p>\n\n<p>Intended use: (Daily Driver, Family Car, Weekend Car, Track Toy, Project Car, Work Truck, Off roading etc.) Daily driver. Must be able to withstand a moderate amount of abuse. Needs to be able to withstand a 20k-30k mile road trip across 6 months while carrying lots of stuff, and hopefully requiring not too much maintenance beyond routine oil and tire stuff during that time.<\/p>\n\n<p>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: most strongly considering Ford Explorer and Chevy Tahoe.

I was having my car serviced at the dealer today (snuck in final maintenance before the three year freebies ended).
