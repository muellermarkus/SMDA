I know it&#39;s low for this car but I think I could find an older model for this price. I would also just want the base model. The only reviews I could find on YouTube were for the turbo models. Has anyone had any luck finding a cheaper used model? Does anyone who has this car like it? Is there a different car that might be a better option?

I&#39;ve put on 45,000 miles so far, but over the past 3 years its been a consistent 8k mi\/yr. Only things I hate is that the cargo area sucks and Fuel efficiency is not that great (24-25 mpg?). The actual trunk space doesnt have to be massive, but having folding seats (especially going completely flat) that expands the cargo area is what I am looking for the most. I like to floor it whenever I can, but I don&#39;t care about max speed. I am 6&#39;2&quot; and somehow average height for my friends, so I gotta make sure there is enough head space in both the driver and passenger seats. AWD\/4WD would be nice, but I am confident in my winter driving to go with FWD, so it isn&#39;t a necessity. I am also not &quot;in the market&quot; right now, but will be in the next 1-3 years. Car doesn&#39;t have to be the new year model, I just don&#39;t want to drive a used car. I feel like I am being really picky, but there&#39;s gotta be a few options out there for me.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Edit: Also from using other people&#39;s cars, I hate the lower angled windshields, probably because of my height. It feels like it cramps my view of the road.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<\/div>","107":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[gel\u00f6scht]<\/p>\n<\/div>","108":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Looking for a budget electric car.
