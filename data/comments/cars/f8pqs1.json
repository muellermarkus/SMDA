I wanted a GM B-Body, like a Roadmaster or Caprice, but those are getting to the age where they don&#39;t really make sense as daily drivers. Plus the gas mileage is ass. The older Lexus LS300 was my next choice, but its very difficult to find good ones in my budget.

Edit: Finished the driving school in a manual but after that I&#39;ve mostly driven a DSG vw passat. I&#39;ve also driven quite a few VAG cars as I work for one of the companies under it (driven GTIs, GTDs, cupras, Golf Rs, even a short stint in a 911), I&#39;ve also driven the new Focus ST with the 2.3L, its an amazing car and I loved it but the manual was too stressful for me, I&#39;m not very open to a manual but would love to have my mind changed. Was thinking of renting a manual for easter and driving it back home to see if I could live with one.<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<\/div>","30":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[gel\u00f6scht]<\/p>\n<\/div>","31":"<div class=\"md\"><p>\u2022 Location: New England, US<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Price range: 20-33k<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Lease or Buy: Buy<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 New or used: New<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Type of vehicle: SUV\/hatchback (think camping\/hiking ready)<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Must haves: AWD, Android Auto, Backup Camera<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc): Auto<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Intended use: Daily drives through Boston, long distance travel to upstate New York, New Hampshire, Maine Vermont<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: Subaru Outback, Toyota Tacoma, Honda Passport<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Is this your 1st vehicle: No<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Do you need a Warranty: No<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle: (fluids, alternator, battery, brake pads etc): some minor work<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Can you do Major work on your own vehicle: (engine and transmission, timing belt\/chains, body work, suspension etc ) no<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Additional Notes:<\/p>\n\n<p>Currently own a 2010 Altima that I love, but the maintenance is starting to add up and with having to travel more for my work I feel less secure on the road.<\/p>\n\n<p>Wife wants to hike camp more with our new pup so I&#39;m looking for a decent middle ground.

Looking for another truck as I am moving apartments next month and I like having the carrying capacity. I\u2019m not a big spender so a cheap old truck that will give me at least a year of use without issues is what I am looking for.

Realistically I know what I SHOULD be considering but I&#39;m already driving it and I&#39;m bored to absolute tears with it - 2016 Lexus ES 350. Meh. So much meh.

My current car is nice enough and will last forever but I have literally no attachment to it. I miss liking driving. I wouldn&#39;t mind a full size pickup or SUV so I can actually have the option of going to home depot for stuff. I would love a 4 seater manual V8 sport coupe that is fun to drive and one I can still drive my young children around in. I&#39;m in love with a couple 2013\/2014 Audi S8&#39;s but I am terrified of the cost of ownership with it being a twin turbo V8 and 60,000+ miles. In short, I just want to WANT to drive like I used to when I had my 5-speed Integra in college or my mud ready Jeep Cherokee or the 1995 Ford Taurus that I used to ramp off the railroad tracks. I&#39;m lookin for true bang for the buck --&gt; Fun, useful, &quot;reasonable&quot; cost of ownership, reliability, MPG.
