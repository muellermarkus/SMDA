Her daily drives are about ten miles (meaning she can run on all electric most days).  Her new vehicle will also replace my truck as our &quot;adventure\/road-trip&quot; vehicle for our one-child family (Rubicons are far more capable than my &quot;trail boss&quot; Silverado).  We also live close enough to get delivery services for anything else I&#39;d use a truck for leaving me to consider moving on from the truck and into something that&#39;ll fit in the garage and be more fun to drive.<\/p>\n\n<p>Even as a teenager I never wanted to buy a Mustang--instead I would&#39;ve wanted to opt for the GT.  Likewise when looking at BMW I started telling myself it&#39;d be far more exciting and special to drive one with the inline-6.  I know I don&#39;t <em>need<\/em> a V6 just like I don&#39;t <em>need<\/em> a BMW.

My fear is that if I do that I&#39;ll start to resent how much we paid for the wife&#39;s Wrangler while I drive a &quot;lesser&quot; vehicle.  Yeah, I admit it--<em>I&#39;m dumb like that<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve considered a slightly more affordable CPO BMW M240i but shy away from it I feel too old for it (I&#39;ll be 40 this year).  Plus I&#39;m sure letting my daughter in-and-out of the backseat will become a pain.  But I&#39;m sure with the seats folded down it could hold whatever I need for golf or solo trips.<\/p>\n\n<p>That brings me to either a new or CPO 3-series.  Going to the M340i is a huge price jump compared to an older CPO 340i.  Or I could reduce the cost by accepting the 330i as I&#39;m never going to take it to a track anyway but for those I&#39;d want the newer body style which brings the price back up a bit but still doesn&#39;t have <em>everything<\/em> I&#39;d want (adaptive cruise and active lane assist would be nice!).<\/p>\n\n<p>So I&#39;ve been hopelessly doing mental gymnastics for months and don&#39;t think I&#39;m any closer to knowing what to do.

So am I stuck going WRX\/STI if I want a performance car with a manual I can take in the mountains and snow, and have space to carry tents and such? Honestly I\u2019d even consider like a turbo forester (if they can even be found in manual) cause the EJ is the shit and I do trust subaru. <\/p>\n\n<p>Thanks for reading<\/p>\n<\/div>","34":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[gel\u00f6scht]<\/p>\n<\/div>","35":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: Canada, Southern Central Ontario<\/p>\n\n<p>Price range: &lt;60k CAD<\/p>\n\n<p>Lease or Buy: Buy<\/p>\n\n<p>New or used: New<\/p>\n\n<p>Type of vehicle: Compact\/Midsize SUV<\/p>\n\n<p>Must haves: IIHS Top Safety Pick+ (or IIHS Top Safety Pick that doesn&#39;t get + rating because of child seat hardpoints in the rear), good headlights (LED turn adaptive), minimum 185 HP, Good\/Excellent cost of ownership, 5 seats, Trunk space to fit 2 full size hockey bags, good headroom in front and rear (shortest user is 6&#39; tall), navigation, lane departure, active cruise control, fuel efficient, buttons preferred vs. touchscreen for radio\/climate control<\/p>\n\n<p>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc): Automatic, no flappy paddle gear shift<\/p>\n\n<p>Intended use: Daily driver (4ish days a week)<\/p>\n\n<p>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: See additional notes. \nEliminated Ford Explorer (high cost of ownership), Chevrolet Equinox (generally underwhelming), Hyundai Santa Fe (headroom issues), Toyota RAV-4 (front row knee length issues), Lincoln Navigator\/Nautilus (too expensive for what you get in my opinion)<\/p>\n\n<p>Is this your 1st vehicle: No<\/p>\n\n<p>Do you need a Warranty: Whatever comes is fine, not really worried about this as a buying point<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle: No, go to mechanic<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle: No, go to mechanic<\/p>\n\n<p>Additional Notes: Done lots of research and narrowed it down.

Unfortunately (in my opinion), I can&#39;t quite rationalize another Tesla for my budget. There are also some problems with Teslas that make this decision easier (e.g. the continued broken promises of Full-Self-Driving). Anyway, I love the feel of driving it, I guess that is mainly the smooth acceleration with very little noise, along with regen braking. I also love the large touchscreen and lack of buttons\/dials\/etc. None of this is required in my next car, but preferred. Another thing I&#39;ve been thinking about is the &quot;true&quot; cost of ownership. Model 3s seem to have very little yearly maintenance costs, so I don&#39;t want to save $10k by buying a different car, only to spend $10k more over the next couple years on maintenance.<\/p>\n\n<p>Any advice here would be awesome.

I\u2019m looking to take advantage of the hot car selling market and am looking to trade in my 2019 civic toward an Audi A5.<\/p>\n\n<p>I found a 2019 CPO Audi A5 Premium Plus sportback with 3,400 miles for an out the door price of $44,000.<\/p>\n\n<p>A little info about me. I recently turned 25. I make $53,000 a year assuming 0 overtime and no bonus. When everything is calculated I make a realistic $63,000 a year. <\/p>\n\n<p>After 401k\/ROTH (11% of my earnings) I take home $3,000 monthly.

This is all from about 1.5years of working (and only 10months at my current job which is by far my highest paying job).<\/p>\n\n<p>The audi would cost me $44,000 out the door. My civic would contribute $11,500 to that. So I would be financing $33,080 when all the math is properly done.<\/p>\n\n<p>I got a rate of 2.65% and 72 months of payment at $498 a month. Insurance would now be $140 a month and i would now need premium gas and have worse mpg.

I have a few cars on mind. The first one will the Lexus GS F 2017 with 20-30k miles, this car goes for 50-60k in an amazing conditions.  The cars is only RWD and the area that I live in USA, the snow is something to take consideration. I will add a supercharger and a few other items to get the car up to 600-650HP to the &quot;wheel&quot;. I feel that the car as being a Toyota, it will be able to handle the power. As ppl say is just the heavier version of the Camry. (Note: I come from a GS 350 F- Sport  2015 AWD).  Next car on the list will be the Audi RS7 2017-2018 Performance. With 15-25k miles. This cars can go for 75-85k USD in amazing conditions. This car is AWD and from my understanding quattro is one of the best AWD system out there. The info system is a lot more updated than the GS F, it has more technology and it has a lot cool features, but at what price? Is reliable good?. Ideas for this car is start with a tune and a few extras, I will try to get it up to 600-650HP to the wheel, the car looks amazing and it always was the car to try to achieve until the 2021 came out and now I want the 2021 but is out of budget so that will be another story.  Now, the final vehicle is the BMW M5 2018, with 20-30k miles, goes around 70-80k USD, in amazing conditions. AWD too. Everything looks amazing in this car, has a lot of technology and everything looks interesting. Ideas for this car will be the same for the Audi, a tune and a few extras to get up to 600-650hp to the wheel. Now, reliably in this car? What you guys think? Is Audi or BMW reliable for with this cars? Turbos in Audi, engines in BMW, and transmission in Toyota. I will put down payments, 30k to 40k in the Lexus, Audi 50-60k and BMW 40-50K.\nOther hand, mods for the Lexus will be around 10-15k to get it up to 600-650 hp. The Audi and BMW, i still do not have an estimate. Any ideas?
