current generation MDX<\/li>\n<li>Modicum of reliability &amp; sensibility<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Current stable: Audi B8 S4 (mine), 2016 Acura MDX (hers)<\/p>\n\n<p>Looking for a replacement for the S4.  Looking at larger SUV that have similar family hauling abilities as the MDX.<\/p>\n\n<p>Primary  new car duty: commuting into the city (60 miles total daily), secondary  duties: weekend family hauling and road trips.  Both secondary duties  are currently being handled 100% by the MDX.  Road trips include regular  jaunts of 300 miles to visit family up to and including trips up and  down the eastern sea board from ME to Virginia.<\/p>\n\n<p>Recent drives:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Toyota  4Runner  - Macho Man of the group.  Great off-road capability.  Primitive from from the stand point of highway driving &amp; lacks any  real safety tech.  TRD Pro looks legit.  Wife was getting sea sick from  the truck-ish ride in a base SR5. Limited trim is not handsome  (braceface!).  Only Limited trim come with full-time AWD mode (plus 4H  &amp; 4L transfer case with locking center diff; other models are  part-time 4WD)  Notorious for steering shimmy at 60mph that dealers  cannot correct, I don&#39;t want to chance it either since I drive a lot of  highway miles.<\/li>\n<li>Lexus  GX460 - Nice Toyota Prado with a predator Lexus grille.  V8 is much  better than the 4Runner&#39;s V6; although I would fear getting 10mpg with  my lead foot.  Dated electronics.  Interior packaging is not great  versus more modern CUV competitors. Perception of Top tier reliability.   Authentic SUV capability, but I don&#39;t offroad and I don&#39;t tow<\/li>\n<li>Lexus  RX350L - Great driver in comparison tot he GX460 on B2B test drives.   Annoying infotainment mouse(!). Too small - Is this the best they could  come up with?<\/li>\n<li>Audi  SQ5 - S4 on stilts.  More compact than the others.  On the one hand  it&#39;s a nice car - had one multiple days as a loaner.  Great driver, but  ultimately felt gimmicky - Like Audi was trolling S4 owners who need a  utility vehicle (me!).  Is it unfair to call it a $65K CRV?  I&#39;ve read  posts on Audizine where multiple owners have complained that the  twin-scroll turbo engines in their B9 S4&#39;s are grenading early.  Same  engine as found in the SQ5.<\/li>\n<li>Audi  B9 S4 - I drove this before I was ready to admit that I need to step  away from mid-sized sedans, at least for now.  Nice to drive a turbo  Audi again, hated the artificially pumped in engine noise.  No Manual  transmission (boo-hiss!).  Electronics &quot;felt&quot; too gimmicky for an S4.   See engine grenading fears up above.<\/li>\n<li>AudiQ7  Premium Plus- I was ready to commit after driving it this weekend.   Have owned multiple Audi&#39;s and this one checked my boxes.  Supercharged  3.0 V6 in the engine bay made me feel right at home.  2nd row is roomier  than the Mrs&#39; MDX.  Cargo area appears to be on par with the MDX.   Solid suspension.  Infotainment &amp; MMI that I&#39;m already used to.   More expensive than the MDX.  Disappointed by not much front storage  space in the Q7 compared ot the MDX (or even my S4 for that matter) .  I  started to crunch my numbers, look at options, local inventory, and  reviews.  Q7 P+, 20&quot; wheels, metallic paint, Vision pkg, Cold &amp; Warm  weather packages, Driver assistance pkg, Tow Pkg, and dealer add-ons  like crossbars comes in at $72K MSRP.  One local dealer advertising this  build for $64.9K for a 2018; new 2019&#39;s are starting to come in at  port.  Then it hits me, this car does not include a spare tire of any  kind which feels like a complete deal breaker since I would be ferrying  the family far enough away from civilization that I would not want to be  without a spare; especially with special order run flat tires.  This  may not be a problem for a city dwelling life, but not cool if you plan  to be out in the sticks.  Other fear: Bleeding edge of electronics =  long term reliability miseries.  Expensive service upkeep (gotta pay to  play or is a sucker born every minute?).<\/li>\n<li>2016  Volvo XC90 - Drove this in 2016 when shopping for the wife.  The  stop\/start was annoying.  The 4cyl turbo\/supercharged engine was rough  and seemed like it was only a matter of time before things would go bad.   Despised all vehicle controls being run off of a tablet.  Noisy A\/C  fans in the interior.. It was VERY bad, maybe was a defect?  Personal  suspicions of poor reliability and quality: model on the showroom floor  had broken door handle, poor perception of quality from early 2000&#39;s,  purchase by Chinese Geely is a personal turn-off.<\/li>\n<li>2016  Honda Pilot: Too mini-van&#39;ish.  My wife was coming out of the prior  generation Pilot but she did not like this.  Ended up with the MDX.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>I  dont have to buy now, but I am on the lookout.  Need to be prepared  when the time comes; although I was very close to  wanting to pull the  trigger on a Q7.<\/p>\n<\/div>","1":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: Cincinnati, OH<\/p>\n\n<p>Price range: Max $4000, prefer to be under $2.5k<\/p>\n\n<p>Lease or Buy: Buy<\/p>\n\n<p>New or used: Used<\/p>\n\n<p>Type of vehicle: Car<\/p>\n\n<p>Must haves: Fuel Efficient, reliable, and has to have a manual<\/p>\n\n<p>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc): Manual<\/p>\n\n<p>Intended use: Daily Driver to save money on gas<\/p>\n\n<p>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: Honda Insight, Honda Fit, Mazda 3, Toyota Echo, Toyota Corolla, etc. All the cheap MPG cars.<\/p>\n\n<p>Is this your 1st vehicle: Nope<\/p>\n\n<p>Do you need a Warranty: Nope<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle: Yep<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle: Yep<\/p>\n\n<p>Additional Notes: Selling my GS for a cheaper, better MPG vehicle.

Some people might think driving a 4th gen in NW PA right off the the lake is crazy; you have to understand that to us waking up to 8\u201d of snow isn\u2019t even noteworthy, nobody will mention it at work that day, unless it\u2019s an absolute blizzard people will ride your ass in the snow if you\u2019re not speeding. We don\u2019t know any different and it\u2019s totally normal, everyone grows up driving in it, we also have insane amounts of plow trucks that generally do a good job. So, putting winter tires on a Camaro(which btw has the same ground clearance as my Chevy cruze, I measured it) and ripping it in the snow isn\u2019t totally unusual. The bottom line is I wouldn\u2019t be shocked if I got screwed maybe 2-3 days all winter long and either get stuck in a parking lot or just can\u2019t get my car moving at all in the first place and I have to get a ride that day to work or whatever, I\u2019m absolutely willing to do that as that happens to people all the time as it is, I would also be willing to get studded tires if I had to. That said, I\u2019m not excited about the idea and having an awd 3 series with blizzaks sounds like a shit load of fun and reliability, but it drives well and the interior plastics don\u2019t moan like the not so great looking live axel Camaro :) send help.

I&#39;ve had 40+ cars, including a few track worthy cars.  I&#39;ve been out of the game for awhile.  Now that the kids have grown up and moved out and given back my garage and driveway space, it&#39;s time for my one last modified car.  This probably will be a car that I keep for a long time, and possibly my last real high performance car.   My current vehicle is a 2014 BMW X5 xdrive 50i.  \nThe biggest bang for the buck cars on my list are the American cars.   I&#39;m seeing CPO 2016 Camaro SS 1LE&#39;s for mid $30K, and 2015-2016 Stingray Z51&#39;s and Shelby GT 350&#39;s also for mid-$40K&#39;s.   However, I do have a fondness for the Audi RS5.  For me, the B8\/B8.5 coupe is a beautiful and timeless design, a car that will look beautiful forever.  I think at some point in time, it will have a cult following similar to the older B7 Audi RS4.  \nThe RS5, M4, and M2 have barely usable rear seats.  The Mustang and Camaro&#39;s rear seats are virtually useless for passengers.  \nThe Porsche is on my list because the 987.2 911 Carrera S is falling within my price range.  I do have a good Porsche mechanic, but it is still a 9 year old car, lacking a lot of the more modern tech features.  But that being said, the 987.2 is pretty much bullet proof, providing I find one that hasn&#39;t been used and abused.\nCadillac ATS-V and CTS-V&#39;s would be on my list if it were not for their terrible ergonomics.  The CUE infotainment system is just flat out horrible.  \nThe Audi S6 and BMW M5 are recent additions to my list.  I had the opportunity to ride (but not drive) in both vehicles recently.  I was impressed by both cars and was surprised to find that they don&#39;t have a lot of resale value.\nAs it stands right now, the top 4 on my list are Audi RS5, Camaro 1LE, Stingray Z51, and Porsche 911.  \nIf anyone wants to add vehicles worth considering or pros and cons of the vehicles above, it would be greatly appreciated.
