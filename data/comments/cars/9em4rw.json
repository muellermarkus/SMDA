Currently driving a Q50 AWD, and enjoying the Infiniti brand right now. I&#39;m use to the V8 Hyundai Genesis, but wouldn&#39;t be buying, nor the GS 2014. I did check out the LS in various years, but I wasn&#39;t sure if they came in bluetooth which would be an annoying compromise. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<\/div>","51":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Location: Wisconsin<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Price range:<\/strong>  $10,000-$17,000  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Lease or Buy:  Buy<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>New or used: Used<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Type of vehicle: Car<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Must haves:<\/strong> V8\/Manual\/4 seats.  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc): Has to be manual<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Intended use:<\/strong>  3 season daily driver with room for two car seats.

I&#39;ve looked at the M5 as they now have AWD and 4WD versions of the Porsche 911, but looking for other suggestions.

I wouldn&#39;t mind a pickup truck as long as it had an adequate number of safe, usable seats.<br\/>\nMust haves: must be at least a little bit fuel efficient. Nothing more than 6 cylinders, for example. Preferably 4. Also only fwd or rwd. It has to be fun, interesting, or maybe even a little bit challenging to drive. I would love it to be something that looks interesting too. I don&#39;t really want one that looks exactly the same as all generic cars these days. Also it must be easy to work on.<br\/>\nTransmission: MUST be manual<br\/>\nIntended use: daily driver, fun car to go for a drive in, maybe to haul stuff in if it has decent cargo capacity.<br\/>\nVehicles I&#39;ve considered: Foxbody Mustang (4 cyl), Honda Prelude, Nissan Versa, Volvo 245, Toyota Celica, Dodge Dakota (4 cyl).<br\/>\n1st vehicle: yes<br\/>\nwarranty: probably not necessary<br\/>\nI can do minor work myself<br\/>\nI want to learn how to do more major stuff. My girlfriend&#39;s dad is a mechanic so he can help me out some and my dad used to be one.<br\/>\nAdditional notes: Recently I was thinking a heavier RWD car might be fun. I kind of like the challenge of a larger vehicle, which is why I&#39;m a bit of a truck simulator enthusiast. A Volvo 240 would be lovely but I haven&#39;t found one for sale around me. There was a 245 station wagon but it&#39;s been sold since then and I&#39;m regretting not checking it out. This will be the first car of my own. Since I&#39;ve learned to drive I&#39;ve been using my parents&#39; car (Honda Civic) which they don&#39;t drive anymore because they like the other one (Nissan Versa) better. So do I, tbh. Anyway I&#39;ve always wanted a manual transmission, so I decided to save up my money to buy my own car. I also want to learn how to be a good mechanic, mostly for fun, possibly as a career, idk yet.<\/p>\n<\/div>","83":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[entfernt]<\/p>\n<\/div>","84":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: Central Oklahoma, USA<\/p>\n\n<p>Price range: $9000 max<\/p>\n\n<p>Lease or Buy: Buy<\/p>\n\n<p>New or used: Used<\/p>\n\n<p>Type of vehicle: Sedan (or possibly smaller SUV)<\/p>\n\n<p>Must haves: decent fuel economy, four doors, leather seats<\/p>\n\n<p>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc): automatic<\/p>\n\n<p>Intended use: daily driver<\/p>\n\n<p>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: Used Lexus ES350, used Lexus LS430, used Lexus RX350, used Toyota Avalon, used Toyota Camry, used Honda Accord<\/p>\n\n<p>Is this your 1st vehicle: No<\/p>\n\n<p>Do you need a Warranty: No<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle: Yes; I&#39;m set up to do most minor maintenance in my home shop.<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle: Comfortable with suspension work, some body work.
