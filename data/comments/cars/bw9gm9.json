I&#39;m coming to the realization that my daily can&#39;t also be my project. I&#39;m leaning very heavily towards body on frame cars, as I&#39;d really like to be able to customize and personalize whatever I get. Affordability and simplicity are the goal here. I really am after a car that has some history, and evokes some emotion when driving. It doesn&#39;t have to be a monster, but I can appreciate fun handling. <\/p>\n\n<p>Recently I&#39;ve fallen in love with rag top super beetles. The idea of the open air, rowing through the 4 speed box, and the rear engine all make me excited. It just seems like such a fun cruising car. I also love how simple they are, with the air cooled carburated engine and independent suspension. It also seems like something a lot of people really put their own stamp on, and they seem to be dirt cheap (both the car and parts). Also, since they aren&#39;t all that old (compared to street rods from the 30&#39;s and 40&#39;s), a lot seem to be in good shape. Before I start seriously shopping for one though, are there other cars I should consider?  I really liked the look of the Opel GT as well, but it seems like it&#39;s too performance oriented and would just make me want to drive my FRS instead.<\/p>\n<\/div>","8":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[gel\u00f6scht]<\/p>\n<\/div>","9":"<div class=\"md\"><p>\u2022 Location: Arizona, usa<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Price range: 4-6k USD<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Lease or Buy: buy<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 New or used: used<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Type of vehicle: crossover or sedan<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Must haves: good mpg, able to fit 4 grown men comfortably, extreme reliability<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Desired transmission: no preference, own both<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Intended use: Daily commuter and carpool vehicle. 80 miles hwy each way.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: ls400, ls430, gx300, Toyota avalon, highlander, mazda 6, mazda cx5<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Is this your 1st vehicle: no<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Do you need a Warranty: no<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle: yes<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Can you do Major work on your own vehicle: yes<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Additional Notes: comfort is #1, mpg is #2.

I&#39;m coming from a Scion tC that I&#39;ve dumped a ton of money in. 400 HP turbo&#39;d and built, but I swear every week... something else breaks. I want a brand new car. I&#39;ve been eyeing the Mustang GT and Civic Type R, but I can&#39;t decide. I love the Blow Off sound and know right out the gate I&#39;d drop $500 for the HKS, but I&#39;ve also never had a car that made thay much horse power with all motor like the Mustang. I&#39;ve had bikes and such, but not anything full motor. All my car buddies tell me to go 10 speed automatic on the Mustang if I did get it, but I&#39;ve always been a manual guy it just feels more like I&#39;m controlling it and I feel like a poser if it&#39;s auto. Also Ford has a deal with no APR and the payments with the accessories work out to less monthly than the Type R with no add ons. The GT would have Adaptive Exhaust, Performance 1, and an upgraded radio for $550 a month.

The stroller, water canisters and any other required baggage goes into the trunk, so you could use this trunk size for reference. I tried fitting these things into the new Corolla Touring Sport hybrid, and they do fit, although not as well as in the old Avensis. Regarding trunk sizes overall, they are often presented in liters, but I usually find these numbers not really telling much. Take my current car and the new Corolla as an example again. According to a quick google, the 2004 Avensis wagon has 520 l trunk space while the new Corolla has ~580 l, but the trunk of my old Avensis is somehow bigger in practice. The stuff I usually need to get into the trunk fits more easily into the old Avensis. The Volvo V90 is supposedly a BIG car. Trunk volume? 560 l. My guess is that one should also look at trunk floor area, but it is never reported.<\/p>\n\n<p>Engine, power and fuel economy: I have no actual requirements regarding these. Low fuel consumption is of course good. High power is also good. Although I am realistically not looking for anything with more than 200 hp. <\/p>\n\n<p>Additional thoughts: In my family, we have only had Toyotas because they are reliable cars. And I do value reliability a lot. I do <em>not<\/em> want to be left at the side of the road. And remember that I live in Finland, where it is cold and the roads are covered in snow half the time. However, I do realize that I am probably biased and also, I know very little of other brands, models and what they offer.<\/p>\n\n<p>So I am basically looking for alternatives to the new Corolla Touring Sports Hybrid. Are there cheaper cars which offer pretty much the same? Are there cars that offer more for the same money?<\/p>\n\n<p>I have actually taken quick looks at e.g. the Ford Focus and the Skoda Superb. The Focus seems to be pretty much the same as the Corolla, but with worse fuel economy, while the Superb has a really nice trunk (my boss has one) but it is a bit more expensive and I don&#39;t want to get a diesel.<\/p>\n\n<p>Reason for not getting a diesel: In Finland, diesel is taxed differently compared with petrol. There is a lower tax when buying diesel, which means that diesel is cheaper to buy, but on the other hand one has to pay an annual flat diesel tax just for owning a diesel car. So one has to drive quite a lot for diesel to actually be cheaper to use than a petrol.<\/p>\n<\/div>","13":"<div class=\"md\"><p><strong>Would you drop $20k for a 6MT VW Alltrack<\/strong> as a daily driver\/canyon car?<\/p>\n\n<p>Suspension parts from the Golf R are plug and play, easily added over a weekend for $500-600.

Everything else is just plain old 2002 corolla.<\/p>\n\n<p>I was looking at honda fits around 2006\/7 with 120-30k miles for 3-4k before this popped up. I&#39;m on the fence here as....sure rubber degrades over time but it wasn&#39;t in a rust belt climate and it has a timing chain vs belt-so worst case scenario I replace all the standard hoses and such?
