This will be a 2016 or 2016.5 model with the 2.5L N\/A engine. Are these cars reliable over 100k miles? I found one with 52k miles for 19.7k and one with 88k miles for 18.7k. I want the cheaper one but dunno the additional 30k miles. The \u2018cheaper\u2019 one is also better specced and is the newer 2016.5 model (more desirable car). Great driving car overall. <\/p>\n\n<p>Nissan Murano 3.5. Likely a 2014-2016 model. They\u2019re all high mile cars &gt;75k miles with a lot over 100k miles. Only reason I\u2019m considering them is they have a VQ 3.5L V6. But it\u2019s paired with a CVT.<\/p>\n\n<p>Any Infiniti SUV\/CUV with a 3.5\/3.7L V6. <\/p>\n\n<p>Any Acura SUV\/CUV with a V6. <\/p>\n\n<p>Lexus RX350. These cars are highly sought after and the current market means I can only find high mile examples or old examples under 20k. So they\u2019re off the list. <\/p>\n\n<p>Subaru Crosstrek: I can\u2019t stand how slow this car is. 0-60 in 10 seconds on a good day. And it has a CVT. I\u2019ve driven a few of them and they drive quite well. The AWD is fantastic but I just can\u2019t bring myself to drive something so awfully slow everyday. <\/p>\n\n<p>Subaru Outback: I can only find older models with the 3.6 engine but not the newest generation under 20k. Crazy pricing on these Subarus. Some of them are selling close to MSRP despite being a few years old. <\/p>\n\n<p>Subaru Forester: tried the XT. Great on paper but the CVT ruined the car\u2019s wonderful motor. It also sits you very very high and isn\u2019t as sporty as people make it seem on the internet. Very high quality car though.

We currently have a 2011 VW Jetta with about 120K on it, but, we now have 2 small kids, and it&#39;s getting very cramped. We hope this car will last 10 years, and can pay cash for it. We test drove each of the cars listed above, here are the pros and cons we have with each:<\/p>\n\n<p>Model Y: We loved the drive and feel of the car. Love the fact that we wouldn&#39;t need to use gas stations (we can charge at home, and superchargers are available where we need them). But, we really have issues with the small and cramped 3rd row. Also, slightly worried about getting left behind as technology progresses, and who knows what electric tech will look like in 10 years.<\/p>\n\n<p>Ford Explorer Hybrid: We liked the feel driving the car, and the size seemed good enough. Worried about maintenance costs with Ford. Features were meh.<\/p>\n\n<p>VW Atlas: Loved the size of the car, but, the drive was just ok. Could probably get extra money for trade-in. Features were meh, and it drinks a ton of gas.<\/p>\n\n<p>Hyundai Palisade: Loved the tech (especially blind-spot camera), and the drive and space were fine. We don&#39;t like that it drinks lots of gas, and are worried about reliability with Hyundai.<\/p>\n\n<p>Toyota Highlander Hybrid: We loved the fuel efficiency, and trust them most on reliability. Driving was not impressive, and neither is the tech in the car, and the 3rd row space seemed low.<\/p>\n\n<p>Toyota Sienna: Love the space and fuel economy, but the drive is horrible. Wife will have a hard time getting over &quot;driving a mini-van&quot;.<\/p>\n\n<p>We were also looking at possibly test driving the Volvo XC90 plug-in, since 98% of our driving would be &lt; 50km electric range both ways, but, it would be at the top of our price range with pretty much no features. It seems like it has features we don&#39;t care about (leather wrapped dashboard, ugh, over useful features, like, buttons to automatically raise 3rd row seats)<\/p>\n\n<p>Also, we considered looking at the Pacifica Hybrid, which looks neat, but, Chrysler reputation means we wouldn&#39;t trust the car, so, not interested in buying.<\/p>\n\n<p>We are so confused, nothing matches what we want.

Bought it from my in-laws a couple years back for what they were going to get for it on trade in ($3,500).  I detail it once a year and keep it very clean throughout the year.  I&#39;ve recently done lots of routine maintenance: transmission flush, new spark plugs, new rotors and pads on the rear wheels, air filters, oil change as well as new door lock actuators, a new head gasket, pcv valve, and MAP sensor.  It&#39;s in great condition and the only maintenance needed on it is to replace it&#39;s 5 year old battery, coolant flush, and new tires in the next 12-16 months. Kbb currently at $6,000<\/p>\n\n<p>My in-laws are now offering us their 2009 Xc90 3.2L with 145k miles on it.  It&#39;s going to need a bunch of routine maintenance ~$1,500-2,000 and some tlc.  Kbb currently at $5,500-6,000<\/p>\n\n<p>We have a 2.5 year old and a baby on the way, the SUV would be much nicer for hauling the kids around.  The AWD would be nice but we do have a Subaru and if the roads are bad my wife is a teacher and will likely be staying home.  Is it a smart move to essentially switch cars?  We figured we would keep the Jetta for another 4-5 years (a little before next big maintenance interval) and get something new and nice.  Can we get 5-7 years out of the Volvo? We&#39;d want to hold on to it a little longer as it would fit our family better and especially if we&#39;re going to have to dump some cash in it right away.<\/p>\n<\/div>","75":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Can&#39;t believe I&#39;m posting one of these, but really struggling as I think some of my and my wife&#39;s requirements are a bit in conflict with each other!<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Location:<\/strong> rural England<br\/>\n<strong>Price range:<\/strong> Split between 2 cars maybe \u00a325k up to \u00a345k absolute max<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Lease or Buy:<\/strong> Buy (with HP finance if toward the upper end of the budget)<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>New or used:<\/strong> Used<br\/>\n<strong>Type of vehicle:<\/strong> Two cars - <\/p>\n\n<p>1) majority of spend on a large family premium SUV (we currently have a 2017 Merc GLS 350d AMG with pretty much every extra, we&#39;ve had for a year and love, but looking to spend a bit less to be honest!)<\/p>\n\n<p>2) then maybe something a bit fun?

I&#39;d love an EV but don&#39;t think there&#39;s a suitable one in our budget yet. Gotta have a premium feel, smooth ride, at minimum reverse camera and front and rear sensors but preferably full 360 camera, other high spec stuff that we have now and I&#39;d probably miss would be auto-adaptive headlights, fancy cruise control that maintains distance in moving traffic and aids steering, basically our GLS has *everything* and we *love* it, but it gets like 11mpg on the school run and I feel like an environmental terrorist, plus the finance payment is obscene, so yes I realize I&#39;m gonna be downgrading a bit here no matter what<\/p>\n\n<p>2) Fun.

A couple of years ago we had a knackered 2003 Mondeo and a battered 2003 Discovery 2 and we were perfectly happy. I have a much better job now and money clearly changes people! But yeah, if Merc made the GLS as a PHEV or EV this would be a no-brainer. We&#39;d been leaning heavily towards the X5 40e, but as my wife pushes the budget higher to get a slightly nicer \/ lower mileage X5 I find myself thinking the XC90 T8 is the more practical option. Then there&#39;s the Q7 e-Tron. I dunno. I worry in an X5 the cargo space is still going to be a fair bit less than we have in the GLS with 3rd row down, it&#39;s cavernous, and we have been known to fill it when traveling with a dog crate + luggage.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Is this your 1st vehicle:<\/strong> Nah<br\/>\n<strong>Do you need a Warranty:<\/strong> The more expensive one will need to come from a business not a private sale, so at least the legal minimum protection applies<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Minor \/ Major work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> Yes both, I am very capable, but in practice since we stopped driving junkers a couple of years ago I don&#39;t really work on them myself anymore<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Additional Notes:<\/strong> Think I covered everything in my overly verbose answers above.
