That car was awesome, steering was amazing, it was pretty fast and comfortable. However, my needs are a bit different, and I don&#39;t want to copycat his purchase. I am aware of BMW xDrive, but not sure about reliability or cost.<\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m in the PNW which means a fair bit of rain, hills, and occasional snow. In addition, I drive to Central Oregon about 2x a month, either to go skiing or visit family. This means going over mountains, and for that, AWD is preferred but not absolutely mandatory. I considered an &#39;05 V6 Mustang but dropped it because it wouldn&#39;t handle snow well. I considered an &#39;06 Audi A6 Quattro, but dropped because of salvage title and family&#39;s anecdotes on mid-2000s Audi reliability. Looked at a beautiful &#39;03 WRX Bugeye sedan, manual, with only 85k miles for 8 grand. I would&#39;ve bought it had I had the money. I think the JDM STIs are out of my price range, but someone correct me if I&#39;m wrong. <\/p>\n\n<p>Just wondering if you guys had any other suggestions for my specific situation. As you can see by my specs, I&#39;m pretty open-minded here. I currently drive an &#39;05 Dodge Dakota which has part-time 4WD, but the gas mileage and low power-weight ratio, as well as handling, don&#39;t make it fun to drive. It has been reliable which is pretty important to me, but occasional repairs are ok. I take care of my truck and will continue to do so. Looking for a replacement in the next year or so.

All three cars have positives and negatives. Not sure which would benefit me most and fit to my lifestyle. I want something newer, with 300+ hp (ideally 400+ with some mods and a tune) and I want something I can daily as well as have fun carving up the 101 here in California. <\/p>\n\n<p>At the end of the day, money isn\u2019t a huge driving factor since I have a low cost living situation for the next few years. What\u2019s most important is the fun, community\/support, and mods. <\/p>\n\n<p>The Ford Focus RS has the best looks to me, it\u2019s got a big aggressive grille similar to my S550 and deep lines down the side body. It\u2019s not to far away from what I would picture to be ideal. However I\u2019m concerned about being upside down on the car, it\u2019s dropping in price and I don\u2019t think it will hold its value, and even so dealers won\u2019t take the sticker price of $45,000 despite KBB rating the car at 29-34k. The drive isn\u2019t great for long road trips, the interior is less than appealing, and there aren\u2019t many on the road. <\/p>\n\n<p>The Golf R feels homey. My first car was a GTI, and my brother\/best friend are VW fanatics. The benefit of this one for me would be the ability to mod it without worrying about my warranty. Since my brother is a master technician at Volkswagen, I\u2019d get a great deal on the car and get work done under warranty without any stress. The downside is that most of the Golf R\u2019s and GTI\u2019s I see on the road seem to be young women, non-car enthusiasts, or middle aged people who want an affordable luxury car. It\u2019s pretty depressing to see someone with the same car as you and I wave like an idiot with no response back. <\/p>\n\n<p>And finally the STI. Great but dated motor. Fun drive. Moderately aggressive look. Very affordable. HUGE community. <a href=\"\/r\/Subaru\">r\/Subaru<\/a> is an awesome place. Every college campus has 5-10 subbies at all times parked in the back corner. When I\u2019m in my buddies STI we get a ton of waves from people in ALL Subaru\u2019s. It\u2019s an amazing feeling and I love the sense of community in the car. However I don\u2019t know much about the cars response to mods. I prefer hatchbacks so that I can bring my dog places, along with hauling my surfboard and kayaks. <\/p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m really stuck.

I also love the exterior look, the seats (my god, the seats), the interior build quality and sound levels, the big naturally aspirated Japanese V8, impressive transmission behavior considering it&#39;s a conventional slushbox.<\/li>\n<li>Bad: This thing is fatter than I am. Infotainment feels less refined than my Tacoma.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>2015 Audi RS5:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Good: Handling is way better than the Lexus. V8 is more responsive and the infortainment system feels like it&#39;s actually from this decade.<\/li>\n<li>Bad: Reliability concerns primarily, although I&#39;ve heard they&#39;re really making strides in this regard. Seats aren&#39;t as good and it seemed a bit louder at highway speeds. Also the interior, while having nicer materials, didn&#39;t feel as put together as the Lexus.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>2017 Audi TTS:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Good: Man this thing was fun to test drive. Little 4-banger gets great mileage (comparatively). Would be easy to park (don&#39;t laugh, that&#39;s a big deal in this town).<\/li>\n<li>Bad: Same concerns with reliability. Felt more like a sports car than a GT car, not sure how it&#39;d feel on a long trip. Never been a huge fan of the roofline on these, although this gen is nicer.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>2012 Jaguar XKR-S:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Good: Gorgeous and sleek. V8 sounds better than the Lexus. Interior is like crawling into a leather store. Can make the Top Gear &quot;Jaaaaag&quot; jokes.<\/li>\n<li>Bad: Sounds like the transmissions in these cars hate city driving and are prone to overheating. General Jaguar reliability concerns, especially since it won&#39;t be in a toasty garage all the time.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>2018 Kia Stinger GT:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Good: Only brand-new car on the list, would have the full warranty from day 1. Wouldn&#39;t have to pick which friend I like best because this actually has back seats. Great performance for what it is. Also the cheapest despite being brand new.<\/li>\n<li>Bad: Build quality inside is so-so. Oddly noisy inside for an ostensibly GT oriented car. But mostly I would have to set foot in a Kia dealership, and just getting the test drive made me feel like I needed a shower.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Cars I briefly considered, but didn&#39;t really look at. If you can make an argument for a closer look, be my guest:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>BMW. Not only are these a dime a dozen around here, but they&#39;ve been getting roasted for falling apart recently and even their performance cars are coming up meh lately. Also I just don&#39;t like the looks, it feels kinda bland.<\/li>\n<li>Mercedes. Nothing really caught my eye, but I&#39;ll admit I don&#39;t follow this brand very closely.<\/li>\n<li>Mustang\/Camaro. I like them, but I want a bit more refinement and creature comforts these days. I&#39;m getting old, I know.<\/li>\n<li>Corvette.

I bought a used car in cash when I was 18, but now it&#39;s getting really old and I&#39;m starting to have issues with it. Currently I have been sinking about $2000 a year in maintenance in to the car and things keep going on it. I have lost my confidence in it. I plan to dump about $5k in to it and fix it up and give it to someone in my family who needs it more than me... Hopefully after I get it completely worked over it will be good until the end of its life.\nI have no problem buying an economy car like Toyota... I really like the highlander. I live in a place with very, very harsh and icy winters so I need something heavier than my current sedan and I would like something with AWD...\nHowever, since I have a good paying job I have obviously been looking at luxury cars too.\nThe biggest issue though, seems to be that there&#39;s no such thing as a &quot;luxury&quot; car anymore. I can get a Toyota avalon fully loaded for almost the same price as a Lexus ES 350 with all of the same options, motor, etc.\nThe most expensive Ford Explorer is as expensive as some Lexus, BMW, Mercedes, etc. SUVs.\nWhat&#39;s the deal here? Why would I pay the same amount of money for a Ford Explorer or Toyota Avalon when I could buy from a brand with a bit more prestige?\nThanks for your time.<\/p>\n<\/div>","80":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Looking for my first 4x4 - not my first vechicle<\/p>\n\n<p>Search criteria:<\/p>\n\n<p>$5-$6k range <\/p>\n\n<p>Central Florida<\/p>\n\n<p>Buy - Used <\/p>\n\n<p>Automatic<\/p>\n\n<p>Basic maintenance - Yes<\/p>\n\n<p>Major repairs?
