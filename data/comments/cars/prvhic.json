I hunt, hike, camp, love long road trips, do some minor wheeling just for the sake of mud, and I go target shooting deep in the woods. When my rig goes out we come back dirty. I don&#39;t want to change that, but I would really like to not spend $80 every weekend to fill the tank.

Not sure if I can wait long enough to buy either, though. I could opt for a GTI, but I&#39;m not sure if the 2022 models are at dealerships yet. Similar story with the WRX: If the upcoming redesign is more comfortable with a nicer interior than the old one, I&#39;ll definitely put it on the list, but I may not be able to wait that long. The Civic Type R and Veloster N are both great, but the former is too pricey and the latter is too small.

Tried out an S2K since it&#39;s philosophically similar to the FR-S but with less compromise, but the only clean examples I found are $30k+ and this might be blasphemous to say, but the S2K isn&#39;t $15k better (after taxes\/fees) than the FR-S.

I love the Miata more than anything, but hate my QX4. I want to sell it and get a better daily, so I can work on the Miata and leave it on jackstands for weeks and still get to and from work.<\/p>\n\n<p>The predicament I&#39;m in is whether to look for an auto or manual daily. I want a fun sporty sedan from the 90s-early 2000s, and as a car guy, I have a long list of dream sedans I would love to have that fit these needs. e36, e46, e30, Mazdaspeed Protege, Civic, Camry, etc, the list goes on.<\/p>\n\n<p>I love the Miata and have dailyed it at times, and it wasn&#39;t too bad, i enjoy driving and having fun getting through traffic and I have a decently twisty commute to work. However, I live with my girlfriend (who can drive stick around the parking lot), but she wouldn&#39;t drive my car on the streets, as she is not comfortable driving stick, and doesn&#39;t really care to get better. This means if I ever borrow her car, she can&#39;t borrow either of mine. This, along with the fact that in the long run, I&#39;ll probably get sick of the manual at times (longer road trips, late at night when I&#39;m tired, after leg day at the gym, etc.), and if I really want to have a fun drive, I have the Miata to take.<\/p>\n\n<p>The QX4 works great being an auto, but I feel like if i got a sedan I really like and put some subtle mods (coilovers, wheels, and the such), I&#39;d be like &quot;Damn if only this were manual.&quot; It would just feel so wasteful getting a car I&#39;ve been dreaming of, just to get it in automatic, but the perks of automatic entice me.<\/p>\n<\/div>","46":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: Texas, USA<\/p>\n\n<p>Price range: $30,000 - $45,000<\/p>\n\n<p>Lease or Buy: Buy<\/p>\n\n<p>New or used: New<\/p>\n\n<p>Type of vehicle: Medium SUV\/truck(?)<\/p>\n\n<p>Must haves: Storage space, Android\/Apple Auto, AWD, Decently fast\/Hybrid\/Electric<\/p>\n\n<p>Desired transmission: auto <\/p>\n\n<p>Intended use: Daily Driver, possibly a bit of light towing <\/p>\n\n<p>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: Mazda CX-5, Ford Maverick <\/p>\n\n<p>Is this your 1st vehicle: No<\/p>\n\n<p>Do you need a Warranty: Factor warranty is fine. <\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle: Prefer to pay someone to do it<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle: No.<\/p>\n\n<p>Additional Notes:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>\u200bprice range is a bit flexible.<\/li>\n<li>Need enough storage space to fit my dog&#39;s crate on road trips (he gets car sick) <\/li>\n<li>AWD is not a MUST HAVE, but is definitely a Nice To Have.<\/li>\n<li>Speed\/Hybrid\/Electric are not all three required, but it must have one of the three.

The Rivian seems like the most fun but it would stretch the budget and their network is not as established as Tesla. I love their interior colors and choices and the adventure aspect, would also get the EV tax credit on this too.

I think we might live in a PHEV world in 3 to 5 years, so a lease is attractive for now, plus, I could cheaply lease something like a CX-30 for 3 years and ditch it before all the subscriptions kick in. Or I could buy something like the Trailhawk or Subaru that really hold their value decently well out here.<\/p>\n\n<p>New or used: In this market, leaning towards new since I can wait for it to come in and used is tending to be highly expensive anyway (or unavailable)<\/p>\n\n<p>Type of vehicle: Car, small SUV, or crossover. Nothing bigger than a Cherokee KL, for example<\/p>\n\n<p>Must haves: AWD or 4x4, space for a kid carseat, PWR of 1:18 or better preferably, 25+mpg, some amount of ground clearance, android auto \/ carplay, relatively quiet ride, adaptive cruise control, prefer some premium sound system, decent reliability as I already have a project carDesired transmission (auto\/manual, etc): Either is fine<\/p>\n\n<p>Intended use: 90% commuting and visiting family on roads that are cracked and badly paved but have 75+mph speed limits but also have traffic jams in high heat and bitter cold sometimes.

Also needs to be capable of getting up into the snowy or dirt road mountain roads occasionally (and out of a snowed in subdivision).<\/p>\n\n<p>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: Mostly looking at the Cherokee Trailhawk, Subaru Legacy Touring XT (ventilated seats are a nice bonus), Subaru WRX Premium, and the Mazda CX-30 Turbo Premium<\/p>\n\n<p>Is this your 1st vehicle: Not remotely<\/p>\n\n<p>Do you need a Warranty: Not particularly, but new, so ...<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle: Absolutely<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle: Yep, but would prefer less breakage on this car<\/p>\n\n<p>Additional Notes: Considered the Bronco Sport Badlands, but had a ton of road noise and a high sticker price with bad gas mileage. The Rav4 Prime might be awesome, but it&#39;s impossible to get. The Mazda CX-5 is an option, but felt a bit like a minivan compared to the CX-30.
