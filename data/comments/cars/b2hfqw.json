What was considered as a simple coolant leak led to the dealership taking a deep dive into the problem. Looks like the issue is with waterpump, pistons and several major engine issues. The dealership quoted $8000 for a complete engine replacement with labor but says it will still not work like before and will result in a strange rattling noise) We are looking for suggestion for something reliable with the same level of power and space as the CX9.
