class=\"md\"><p>Location: Mid-Michigan with Michigan roads<\/p>\n\n<p>Price range: &lt; $17,000<\/p>\n\n<p>Lease or Buy: Buy<\/p>\n\n<p>New or used: Used<\/p>\n\n<p>Type of vehicle: Small sporty lux sedan\/coupe\/convertible <\/p>\n\n<p>Must haves: 4+ seats, decent to good gas mileage.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Desired transmission: Auto, but my wife would learn manual if price was right. <\/p>\n\n<p>Intended use: Nice weather daily and weekender.  Fun 3rd car because I can&#39;t daily a pickup truck much longer without going insane.  Wife would occasionally drive it long distances to meetings around the state of Michigan. I&#39;d like a convertible, but it&#39;s not a necessity.   <\/p>\n\n<p>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: Audi A3\/A4, BMW 128i\/328i, Cadillac ATS, VW Eos\/GTI, Lexus IS, Acura TSX<\/p>\n\n<p>Is this your 1st vehicle: No<\/p>\n\n<p>Do you need a Warranty: No<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle: (fluids, alternator, battery, brake pads etc): Yes<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle: (engine and transmission, timing belt\/chains, body work, suspension etc ) - some light mechanical work. I can&#39;t do body work, I just have no knack for it. <\/p>\n\n<p>Additional Notes: Had a Buick Regal GS that I daily-ed  for a while and I miss it.  Had to turn it in because we needed a pickup truck (and still do) plus I had some reliability issues with it (broke 3 wheel bearing housings within 4 years of owning it, snapped a accessory belt which did some additional damage to the pulleys that I had to replace....and I am not a rough driver). I wanted a Miata, but the wife threw the &quot;Then we all can&#39;t enjoy it together&quot; card at me (I have 2 kids).  Even though I argued &quot;that&#39;s the point&quot; she has her ways of convincing me...<\/p>\n\n<p>I like German cars...the feel of the Buick was &quot;nearly&quot; German, but not quite.  I test drove a 2011 128i M sport pkg convertible a few weeks ago, but it was bought before I could pull the trigger.  It was a manual, but the price was so good. I like the 3 series too, but I&#39;m concerned about maintenance and reliability of used BMW&#39;s (is it really that bad? I like to do things myself, are BMW&#39;s really all that terrible to work on as their perception?). <\/p>\n\n<p>I test drove a low mileage 2014 Eos, and like it.  It wasn&#39;t as sporty as the 128, but it was comfortable.  I like VW Groups interiors.  That one is still out there.  I offered an initial starting low ball offer and I think I insulted the dealer (despite the fact that they&#39;ve had it for sale since last October...).  I&#39;m concerned about the complicated top.  This one was in good condition and dry (test drove it after a rain storm infact), but if something breaks...<\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;d like a MK7 GTI, but just haven&#39;t found one near me in the price range.  While the hatchback would be nice for our family, I&#39;m just not a fan of the style.  <\/p>\n\n<p>I have also not found an Audi A3\/A4\/A5 in my range without a ton of miles they seem to go fast, and people keep em a while around here. <\/p>\n\n<p>There are a lot of 13-14 Caddy ATS&#39;s around here. I&#39;m concerned about reliability reports of these as well.   I come from a deep rooted GM family, and I&#39;ve owned a ton of GM products and am a little tired of them.  Since I&#39;m buying used, I figured I could go outside a little.  I&#39;ve only recently &quot;come out&quot; as a closet lover of foreign cars. That being said, the Acura TSX and Lexus IS&#39;s I&#39;ve  looked at just don&#39;t do it for me...from a styling perspective than anything else, but they just sort of bore me.  I wish I could get their reliability in something not Lexus or Acura.<\/p>\n\n<p>What&#39;s the opinion of the models I mentioned?  Is there anything else I should be considering.  I need\/want small, I really don&#39;t want to go larger than an ATS\/A5 are the longest cars I&#39;ve listed, and they are a good 8-9 inches shorter than the Regal.  <\/p>\n<\/div>","1":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: (Specify your country or region)\nSoutheast USA<\/p>\n\n<p>Price range: (Minimum-Maximum in your local currency)\n&lt;$20k\nLease or Buy: Buy<\/p>\n\n<p>New or used: Used<\/p>\n\n<p>Type of vehicle: (Truck, Car, Sports Car, Sedan, Crossover, SUV, Racecar, Luxury etc.)<\/p>\n\n<p>Sports car<\/p>\n\n<p>Must haves: (4x4, AWD, Fuel efficient, Navigation, Turbo, V8, V6, Trunk space, Smooth ride, Leather etc.)<\/p>\n\n<p>Fun to drive.

Stinger is by far my favorite all-around, but I think I can only afford to lease the 2.0T version and not the V6 version. Going to test drive it again this weekend, and compare 2.0T vs. V6 more since I&#39;ve only had ~45min with it so far. <\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Camry: No Android Auto (or Apple Carplay, atm). Worst handling. XSE V6 model feels too pricey for what it is, and it&#39;s the only trim I really like.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Accord: Drives great but speaker quality is poor, I don&#39;t like the look of it much, and it feels somewhat &quot;appliance-y&quot; if that makes any sense. This is probably still my top choice, I just want to keep looking in case something really strikes me.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>GTI: Want to test drive again. Felt a little too small first time I test drove, and I spent more time getting annoyed in the dealership than in the car. Had a blast during the 5min of backroads driving I had though.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Stinger: Love the aesthetics and specs. Driving the 2.0T model was fun, but I&#39;ve only spent 45min with it so far and the nicer V6 trims are slightly out of my price range. Seems the best overall but it&#39;s a new model, so I think I&#39;d lease for 36mo with the $6500 lease cash for the 2.0 Premium trim options.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Hoping y&#39;all might give me some other options to test drive.

When I needed a new daily, i shopped the BRZ and Focus ST.  The Focus ST felt disconnected and I already had a turbo car.  The BRZ offered something different(light and RWD).  I still enjoy both cars.  But I&#39;m just thinking of trying something new for a change of pace.  Something like a mustang intrigues me(powerful V8).   The BRZ is lightly modified and fun, but I&#39;ve also considered adding more power like a supercharger.  If I did this I would get a different daily car.  I still haven&#39;t driven one, but the new Mustang really peaks my interest.    <\/p>\n<\/div>","29":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: Florida\nBudget: 10-12k\nTransmission: Manual<\/p>\n\n<p>Fiat 500 Abarth or Ford Fiesta ST?<\/p>\n<\/div>","30":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: Florida\nPrice range: Around $2,500\nLease or Buy: Buy\nType of vehicle: Sedan or something unique\nMust Haves: A decent gas mileage would be nice\nDesired transmission: Auto\nIntended use: Daily driver with friends\nVehicles considered: 2004 Bmw 325i, 2005 Volkswagen jetta gli, 2005 Audi a4\nIs this my first vehicle: Yes, Im 16\nDo you need a warranty: idk\nCan you do minor work: Yes\nMajor work: No\nNotes: Since im 16 i just want something not everyone has<\/p>\n<\/div>","31":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: Silicon Valley<\/p>\n\n<p>Price range: $0 to $45k<\/p>\n\n<p>Lease or Buy: Buy<\/p>\n\n<p>New or used: Used (Preferably CPO)<\/p>\n\n<p>Type of vehicle: Ideally a sporty luxury car<\/p>\n\n<p>Must haves: Roomy - I&#39;m 6&#39;2&quot;, 210lbs<\/p>\n\n<p>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc): Auto<\/p>\n\n<p>Intended use: Daily driver<\/p>\n\n<p>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: Audi A6, BMW 530i<\/p>\n\n<p>Is this your 1st vehicle: No<\/p>\n\n<p>Do you need a Warranty: No but preferable<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle: No<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle: No<\/p>\n\n<p>Additional Notes:  Thoughts on A6 vs 530i?<\/p>\n<\/div>","32":"<div class=\"md\"><ul>\n<li><strong>Location:<\/strong> Central\/North Jersey<\/li>\n<li><strong>Price range:<\/strong> $5000 max<\/li>\n<li><strong>Lease or Buy:<\/strong> buy<\/li>\n<li><strong>New or used:<\/strong> either<\/li>\n<li><strong>Type of vehicle:<\/strong> sedan, any small car<\/li>\n<li><strong>Must haves:<\/strong> good fuel economy, decent safety features<\/li>\n<li><strong>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc):<\/strong> auto<\/li>\n<li><strong>Intended use:<\/strong> daily driving<\/li>\n<li><strong>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered:<\/strong> none<\/li>\n<li><strong>Is this your 1st vehicle:<\/strong> yes<\/li>\n<li><strong>Do you need a Warranty:<\/strong> meh<\/li>\n<li><strong>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> no<\/li>\n<li><strong>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> no<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>","33":"<div class=\"md\"><p>- Location: Upstate NY (all over)<\/p>\n\n<p>- Price range: $10K max<\/p>\n\n<p>- Lease or buy: Buy<\/p>\n\n<p>- New or used: Used<\/p>\n\n<p>- Type of vehicle: Coupe, hatchback, sedan<\/p>\n\n<p>- Must haves: Comfortable for 6&#39;5&quot; driver, comfortable to cruise, not too expensive to maintain, decent to good winter performance, performance!<\/p>\n\n<p>- Transmission: Auto, can learn manual<\/p>\n\n<p>- Intended use: Daily driver, 12K mi\/yr (70\/30 highway\/town)<\/p>\n\n<p>- Vehicles considered: Porsche 911 996 (I wish), BMW E92 335i xDrive (bit pricey, reliability for 100K+ mi?), Subaru WRX (bad cruiser? tacky styling), Audi S4 (pricey, big)<\/p>\n\n<p>- First vehicle: No<\/p>\n\n<p>- Warranty needed: No<\/p>\n\n<p>- Can do minor work: Would like to learn<\/p>\n\n<p>- Can do major work: No<\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve been graciously loaned a 2004 BMW 545i that has some major issues.

Previously I did not care about ground clearance, but this Moab trip convinced me of the benefits of a &#39;sporty crossover&#39;. <\/p>\n<\/div>","78":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: Washington DC Metro Area<\/p>\n\n<p>Price range: Max 18,000 used, 22,000 new<\/p>\n\n<p>Lease or Buy: Would prefer to buy, as I have been taught leasing is throwing money away<\/p>\n\n<p>New or used: Either<\/p>\n\n<p>Type of vehicle: Hatchback (strongly prefer, I&#39;m very tired of parking large cars around the city), compact SUV <\/p>\n\n<p>Must haves: newer than 5 years old, 4 doors, reasonably powerful engine and fun to drive, Decently reliable, able to handle snow\/wintry mix conditions well (I take trips to Ohio occasionally), heated seats.<\/p>\n\n<p>Desired transmission : Automatic<\/p>\n\n<p>Intended use: I drive daily with multiple stops in the city for work, do regional recreational drives, and occasionally have long (200+mi) work travel assignments about once a month.<\/p>\n\n<p>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: Mazda3 (the visibility in the car is not great though), VW Golf, Toyota Rav4, Subaru Impreza<\/p>\n\n<p>Is this your 1st vehicle: Nope, My 1st was a 1997 Infiniti QX4, Currently drive a 2002 Toyota Avalon XLS<\/p>\n\n<p>Do you need a Warranty: Maybe?<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle: Yes, and I learn quick and have access to basic tools and jacks, The most complicated repair I have done was the radiator on the Avalon.<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle: Probably not.<\/p>\n\n<p>Additional Notes:<\/p>\n\n<p>So I have a lot of questions about the options for cars, as my first cars have just been purchased for me (lucky!), or inherited and I have not cared as long as it has driven. I&#39;ve ran into issues with my current car with the airbag sensor, and several places have estimated that it will take around 1.5k-2k to diagnose and fix in order to pass state inspection. So i&#39;m looking for a decent car that is fun to drive\/ has a powerful engine as both cars have had v6&#39;s, and I am now spoiled and like luxury features like heated seats, sunroof, auto climate control, that I have had with my older cars. If it is a large difference in cost I can live without sun roofs, but theres nothing like heated seats on a cold day. I don&#39;t care about navigation, as i use my phone when I need it. I have been test driving a few cars and the mazda3 hatchbacks visibility is lacking for me, felt cramped, and the 2.5L engine still seems weak. I have driven the mazda6 and enjoyed it way more although the engine was the same size, but the sedan seems less practical. I have test driven a golf TDI and absolutely fallen in love with it, good visibility, decent power, and the SEL trim on a used model is well within my range with great features I enjoy. however the use of diesel and reliability makes me nervous about VW, and the fact that the newer golfs have removed a lot of trim options from their newer cars means I may stick to used to get the features I would like.  My mom has stuck with recommending AWD SUVs as she is entirely sure I&#39;ll die in all car accidents without one. My dad just recommends AWD cars and luxury vehicles way out of my price range. He did recommend a golf, but pushed me toward vehicles with AWD, as he says &quot;you don&#39;t need it until you need it&quot;. But its DC, and we rarely need it, and If I do, I telework. So I have looked at the impreza, and looks nice, but people say they are boring as shit. <\/p>\n\n<p>Overall I am pretty paralyzed by my choices. <\/p>\n<\/div>","79":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Anything I should look out for when going to see a 2010 Audi A5 with 150k on it?<\/p>\n<\/div>","80":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Not really the right place to post this, but its car buying related and yall seem knowledgeable, mods can delete if not allowed.

The only thing I really don&#39;t want is a boring looking car. The Malibu is about the only exception to this because I recently drove a rental and I liked the way it handled and rode.

I used this template from a different subreddit to get you some information. Right now I drive a Jeep Wrangler and with a 50-60 mile (mostly highway) daily commute I know that the amount I&#39;m spending in gas is going to take a toll. I&#39;m currently looking into getting a new car that would potentially be temporary (maybe 1- 2.5 years unless the car is worth keeping) until I can afford to move out into a place closer to where I&#39;m going to work. Current thoughts are to find something I can drive for a year or two then sell it when I don&#39;t have a long commute and then use the Jeep.

It has some life left in it, but I&#39;m in a position to purchase something new. My three choices are really my buying positions. The Honda is the most economic (fuel wise and money wise), but I hate the way it looks and the infotainment console is one of the worst and most confusing I&#39;ve ever seen. There are also 2 local Honda dealerships that I&#39;m very comfortable with for repair and service. The Mazda3 feels like a compromise. More hp than the Honda for a little fun, naturally aspirated engine so fewer components to break down, but is very loud, has rather narrow seats that make it uncomfortable, and is prone to rust. The GTI checks the most boxes, but is the most expensive and the most thirsty. It was quiet and comfortable, has a great infotainment console, and is super zippy and fun. My fears with the VW run along the lines of reliability and cost of repairs and service. I&#39;ve obviously never owned a German car before and I do know that the engines of the GTI&#39;s tend to over carbonate around 50k miles. This is a vehicle I&#39;d like to drive for the next 8-10 years so I want to look forward to getting in it every day and I want to be reasonably sure it will last.<\/p>\n<\/div>","131":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: California, USA<\/p>\n\n<p>Price range: $40,000<\/p>\n\n<p>Lease or Buy: Either <\/p>\n\n<p>New or used: Either<\/p>\n\n<p>Type of vehicle: Crossover SUV<\/p>\n\n<p>Must haves: Modern interior, Comfortable ride, Bluetooth<\/p>\n\n<p>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc): Auto <\/p>\n\n<p>Intended use: Daily Driver<\/p>\n\n<p>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: Q3, CX5, XC40<\/p>\n\n<p>Is this your 1st vehicle: Yes<\/p>\n\n<p>Do you need a Warranty: most likely<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle: No<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle: No<\/p>\n\n<p>Looking to buy my first car!
