If it has the same 2.4L as my 2008 Dodge avenger, it should be a great engine. I drove that car to 170k and my mom is still driving it at 190k. Does anyone know anything about these cars?

No noticeable performance issues. Drove it up and down lake shore drive in Chicago.

The price point is great and the dealer said he&#39;d be willing to negotiate down &quot;aggressively&quot; because he&#39;s been sitting on it for so long. For me, I won&#39;t put many miles on at all because I travel for work and would only be using it on the weekends.<\/p>\n\n<p>The other option is a 2014 Rs5.
