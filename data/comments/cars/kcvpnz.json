However the engagement is up my alley and the comfort was significantly better than my ILX and a 2020 civic SI i also test drove. Reason i am not considering 2020 is the manual was pretty bad, long travel clutch and throws, design was meh, Felt far too large.  thought about TYPE R, but after a shitty test drive ( bad dealer\/ salesperson) the car seemed too much for my needs, cant go WOT in 1st or 2nd with out having mad wheel spin, you need to be going extremely fast in order to start having fun.<\/strong>   <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Then I thought a samll SUV(CX-5), perhaps i can just get a comfortable SUV that still has the luxury of not having, touch controls, cvt, start\/stop, but has a good audio\/ infotainment and nice modern luxuries.<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<\/div>","6":"<div class=\"md\"><p>San Diego, California <\/p>\n\n<p>My max is 6000$<\/p>\n\n<p>I wanna buy<\/p>\n\n<p>Used is probaly all I could afford imma student.<\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not looking for anything specific it just needs to be reliable and it needs to be able to handle everyday drive on a dirt road and as far as I know that usually only means SUVs and Trucks .

I&#39;m lowkey sick of it, and I&#39;d like to get a car very soon. Any tips on even websites to look at would be great. Or even cars that simply have great deals currently. We need nothing fancy or expensive, just a fuel friendly new car. The cars above I have considered, but haven&#39;t found a jaw dropping deal quite yet. I don&#39;t really want to jump from dealer to dealer inquiring about what my monthly payments would be until I have what I want in mind. I want to narrow down the results. Thank you in advance for any help or tips.<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<\/div>","16":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: Northern Illinois<\/p>\n\n<p>Price range: $25-35K<\/p>\n\n<p>Lease or Buy: Buy<\/p>\n\n<p>New or used: New or used with low mileage <\/p>\n\n<p>Type of vehicle: SUV or Crossover<\/p>\n\n<p>Must haves: Lumbar support.

I cant stand going all the way down to zero on the highway, so I wanted a car that would do that part for me. Anyway, I decided to leave my safe corporate job for a startup that I&#39;m cofounding, and my commute is going to go down to maybe 10 minutes with rush hour no longer being an issue. I&#39;ll also probably work from home a lot. My income should still be secure, we have funding to include my current salary for 4 years, and the potential upside is massive, but I still don&#39;t want to take on a massive payment right now. <\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>So... I love driving stick and I figured I could probably take something a little less reliable with worse gas mileage for my shorter largely optional commute. I had a 2015 GTI that I loved, and an 08 WRX that I also loved. I&#39;m wide open to all sorts of things here though. I&#39;ve always wanted a manual 3 series, but I don&#39;t know too much about them.<\/p>\n<\/div>","61":"<div class=\"md\"><p>\u2022 Location: North Idaho<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Price range: $2500 USD<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Lease or Buy: Buy<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 New or used: not gonna find a new car at this price range<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Type of vehicle: something that isn&#39;t a pickup or a big SUV (ie ford explorer), ideally a wagon though<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Must haves: Fuel efficient, AWD or 4WD, heater, air conditioning, stereo<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Desired transmission: auto<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Intended use: daily car, I already have a pick-up for work that gets shitty gas mileage.

I was quoted $900 to get all seasons on my truck which is still 2WD at the end of the day, so I&#39;m thinking I could roll with the crappy tires on my pickup for the next little bit since I only use it as a pickup and for hauling Spring-Fall. Plus this would get better gas mileage and it has winter tires that look pretty new already<\/p>\n\n<p>I was going to have someone look at the engine before I got it as I know the timing belts and head gaskets generally break.<\/p>\n\n<p>Does that seem like a good deal? <\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/Upu73Lo\">https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/Upu73Lo<\/a><\/p>\n<\/div>","62":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>Location: CENTRAL TEXAS<\/p>\n\n<p>Price range: $10,000<\/p>\n\n<p>Lease or Buy: BUY WITH CASH<\/p>\n\n<p>New or used: USED<\/p>\n\n<p>Type of vehicle: CREW CAB PICK-UP TRUCK<\/p>\n\n<p>Must haves: 4X4, ROOM FOR A FAMILY OF 4<\/p>\n\n<p>Desired transmission AUTO<\/p>\n\n<p>Intended use: DAILY DRIVER, WE LIVE ON A SMALL HOMESTEAD SO WE NEED SOMETHING TO HAUL ANIMALS,<\/p>\n\n<p>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: \nMID 2000&#39;S F250 TURBO DIESEL AND V8 F150<\/p>\n\n<p>Is this your 1st vehicle: NO<\/p>\n\n<p>Do you need a Warranty: NO BUT I JUST SOMETHING RELIABLE THAT I CAN DRIVE FOR THE NEXT 10 YEARS, NO MORE THAN $500 A YEAR ON MAINTENANCE AND REPAIRS<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle: (fluids, alternator, battery, brake pads etc): YES<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle: (engine and transmission, timing belt\/chains, body work, suspension etc ): NO<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>My big concern is just liability. do you guys think it would be more reliable to get an older diesel truck (between 2005 and 2010) or a new 1500 V8 (between 2010 and 2014).
