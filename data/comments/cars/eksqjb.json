We both drive a 2015 Ford Focus SE and a 2016 Ford Focus Titanium respectively. My parents are looking to purchase my car from me and we would be looking at getting some AWD vehicle that would be my daily driver and then we&#39;d use it for any road or camping trips, transport home depot or craigslist finds for her DIY projects around the apartment, etc. We would just mostly be transporting ourselves and our two dogs (1 small, 1 large) and have no plans on having children. Every once in a while we have family or friends come out and visit so a roomy back row would be nice, but absolutely do not need anything large than a 5-seater. <\/p>\n\n<p>My dad works for Ford and as such I get A-Plan pricing which usually knocks a few Gs off the dealer price and I get 0-1.9% APR financing. However, my girlfriend and I have had very bad experiences with our Focus&#39;s transmissions and Sync 3 in our cars. I don&#39;t mind getting another Ford, but I am hesitant to as of now. I&#39;ve driven Ford my entire life and the prospect of getting something new and different in a Subaru is very enticing. <\/p>\n\n<p>The 2020 Subaru Crosstrek looks like a good inexpensive AWD replacement. I have a friend who loves his and recommended I look at one. However, he said his doesn&#39;t have much power under the hood and driving up in the mountains when it snows it struggles a bit. I like the size, price, and features of the Crosstrek, but the lack of horsepower concerns me.<\/p>\n\n<p>The 2020 Subaru Outback Onyx XT looks like a car I&#39;d absolutely love and have fun driving and using during the week and on weekends. It&#39;d be big enough for us to camp in the back and have plenty of space for the dogs or if friends\/family come to visit and we&#39;re driving them around. It has the turbo engine, non-leather waterproof interior, 11.6&quot; infotainment, all the safety bells and whistles, and checks all of my boxes and then some.  It&#39;s a little pricey and at the top of my budget, but after hours of reading and watching youtube videos it looks like a really fun and solid vehicle.<\/p>\n\n<p>There is a CPO 2019 Subaru Outback 3.6R Touring that has caught my eye at the same dealership. I has ~5k miles, the carfax shows it had a windshield replacement and then went on sale a few days ago and that&#39;s really it. With this, I believe i&#39;d be getting more car for my money since it would be CPO. <\/p>\n\n<p>I plan on going to test drive those four cars this week, but figured I&#39;d get some opinions here in case there&#39;s anything I missed in my research or feedback on my list.

I would like it to seat 4 comfortably (5 if that really is a possibly thing). Not really a car guy, so fuel efficient, safe\/reliable (especially in snow), fairly inexpensive parts\/repairs, and comfortable are most important.

I currently have a GTI Sport but because I\u2019d like to not have any more car payments, I\u2019m looking into a used car. I enjoy driving, in the past I\u2019ve owned a civic SI, Infiniti G35 and a BMW 3 series. I\u2019ll be purchasing this car cash and selling my GTI either to Carmax or Carvana. After my most recent quote, I\u2019ll have about $3k leftover after paying the loan off on my GTI.<\/p>\n\n<p>Extra info - I have two kids, ideally I\u2019d like a sedan for this reason.<\/p>\n<\/div>","73":"<div class=\"md\"><p>UK Approx 1k looking for first car that&#39;s also fairly fun to drive.
