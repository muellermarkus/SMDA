My end goal is a Model 3, but am considering alternatives that might be more attainable sooner. Ford Focus RS would be a fun upgrade as a car I&#39;m already familiar with, and I could keep it around as a weekend car if I get a better daily driver in the future. Audi S3 is more expensive, but would be a fun car, a better daily driver, has adaptive cruise control, and is higher quality, but I come from a family of American and Japanese cars, so I&#39;ve never dealt with the ownership costs of a German luxury car. Hyundai Veloster N is very similar to the Focus ST with some options I&#39;d like such as a DCT and some extra performance, but has a pretty plain interior and is a pretty lateral move from a Focus ST. Would love some input on these cars or some other suggestions to cross-shop.<\/p>\n<\/div>","37":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Location:<\/strong> USA  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Price range:<\/strong> $25k-$45k (+\/-)  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Lease or Buy:<\/strong> Buy  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>New or used:<\/strong> Either, would prefer 2-3 y\/o used unless there&#39;s a specific build I can&#39;t find.  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Type of vehicle:<\/strong> Sedan, Sports Car  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Must haves:<\/strong> Bulletproof powertrain, high build quality, leather  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc):<\/strong> Manual preferred, not a deal breaker  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Intended use:<\/strong> Daily driver, cruising, potentially track day or two (with the right car)  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered:<\/strong> Mustang GT Premium (concerns over MT82 gearbox so may have to...go automatic??
