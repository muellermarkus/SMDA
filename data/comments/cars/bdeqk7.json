It&#39;s started to sound weird, still runs fine (it did blow a spark plug up through a coil but I fixed that a while ago) but it sounds like a motor is struggling (I think possibly one for the timing belt, sounds like the noise is coming from there) and I think all 4 CV axles are starting to go, or at least the front two are, and at $200 a piece with the car only being worth about $1,200 (150k miles on it) max, probably time to look for something new.<\/p>\n\n<p>So I want to start looking for a new one.<\/p>\n\n<p>Location: Utah<\/p>\n\n<p>Price range: $0-$15,000<\/p>\n\n<p>Lease or Buy: Buy (probably from a dealer with a loan)<\/p>\n\n<p>New or used: Used, looking for an older but not too old model, somewhere around 2010, or older with few miles<\/p>\n\n<p>Type of vehicle: Probably an SUV, maybe a truck, maybe a minivan - I need something that can haul sound and stage equipment (plenty of COVERED cargo space), seat a decent number of people (at least have a back seat), and that will be useful for moving in about a year or so, as well as being able to handle off-roading on Utah&#39;s salt flats.<\/p>\n\n<p>Must haves: 4-wheel drive, cargo space, back seat, ability to handle driving in snow (with proper tires) and mud.  Gas mileage can&#39;t be abysmal but can be low, somewhere around 20MPG is acceptable.<\/p>\n\n<p>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc): Automatic, though I can drive a manual if it&#39;d save a few thousand dollars to get a manual instead.<\/p>\n\n<p>Intended use: Daily drive, offroading, DJ work + home maintenance work, moving, driving friends around when we hang out since my friends don&#39;t have cars on account of them living in the heart of a major city.<\/p>\n\n<p>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: I&#39;ve looked at the Honda Pilot, Honda CRV, and a Jeep Wrangler.

But, I&#39;m open to other brands.  I care a little bit about looks but not much, and I&#39;ll probably be getting a custom wrap done anyway.
