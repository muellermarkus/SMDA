I&#39;m looking for a new car. I&#39;m not in a rush and can wait years as 2023 has some interesting ones coming out. I currently drive a Prius with 70k miles so I&#39;m good for awhile. <\/p>\n\n<p>Location: SF, US<\/p>\n\n<p>Price range:\u00a0Max is $150k by would prefer to keep it to $100k<\/p>\n\n<p>Lease or Buy: I&#39;d consider both since I&#39;m so torn. I may just want something for a couple of years. <\/p>\n\n<p>New or used: Either<\/p>\n\n<p>Type of vehicle: sports car or sporty sedan<\/p>\n\n<p>Must haves:\u00a0\n- Fun factor. This is main consideration. \n- Good visibility (the monitor on the rear mirror on the C8 is a nice fix) \n- Ventilated, comfortable seats. I suppose these can always be put in after. I&#39;ve never done any after market mods though. Can a super comfy, 14 way seat be installed later?<\/p>\n\n<p>Desired transmission: automatic <\/p>\n\n<p>Intended use: daily driver. I&#39;m mostly retired and don&#39;t drive many miles. We also have 2 other cars available to me (my husband&#39;s Kia Optima and our converted van) which can be driven if need be.<\/p>\n\n<p>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: \n- Porsche 911 4s\n- Corvette C8\n- Nissan Z\n- Tesla Model 3 Performance for it&#39;s practicality and price point. Great pickup and loved the one pedal driving in the canyons\n- Ioniq 6 for the lounge feel<\/p>\n\n<p>Is this your 1st vehicle: no, 4th<\/p>\n\n<p>Do you need a Warranty: not necessarily<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Minor work:\u00a0no<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Major work:\u00a0no<\/p>\n\n<p>Other info: I&#39;m new to sports cars but I&#39;m fairly interested in them. I&#39;m actually going to take a trip to Las Vegas to drive the C8 and the Porsche 911 to see how I like the cars and learn racing. I&#39;m wondering if I should get more of a moderate car (Nizzan Z) and get it tuned before I get an all out sports car. I don&#39;t know anything about after market mods though, so it feels like a lot to learn about. <\/p>\n\n<p>Thanks everyone for any suggestions!

The jeep is staying because it&#39;s not worth much and I still want an SUV for towing purposes, 4wd, etc. MPG is nice but not super essential for me, my jeep gets like 12 MPG so anything better than that is a W in my book. It will be mainly city driving (to\/from work) with some highway thrown in. I like the M3, but is kind of hard to find one under 30k with less than 100k miles. Mustang GT is kinda similar issue but there are still some viable candidates out there. I plan on doing basic modifications (wheels, tires, exhaust, CAI, etc), mods that are fun but don&#39;t sacrifice reliability since this is my DD. I really like a WRX but with a mustang you get 100 more HP and honestly not a huge sacrifice in MPG. Mustang has pretty good highway MPG. If I go the BMW route, I&#39;m concerned about maintenance especially after breaking the 100k barrier. I want to avoid maintenance as much as possible other than regular interval stuff. I really want a manual (never owned one but know how to drive one) because I&#39;m young (23) and that stuff is fun.

Please understand I\u2019m looking for high level guidance. I had a 2006 Nissan Altima 2.5SL that was totaled from Ida along with my apartment. This car had only 145k miles on it. I planned to drive it for another 10 years because my city life involves me not driving often. It was also keyed, dinged, spray painted, and otherwise defamed a lot as it sat in its parking space. I didn\u2019t care though, I loved that car. When I did need it, it gave me a comfy ride to where I was going. It was the first car I bought.<\/p>\n\n<p>I haven\u2019t done any budgeting for a new car, but I do need a new one in somewhat short order. My situation is particularly complicated because I\u2019m not sure if my next apartment will allow me to continue my preferred walking lifestyle, or if I will be more car dependent. I do like the idea of an SUV or something big enough to sleep in as that has saved me from some bad camping experiences. If I was going SUV, I\u2019d like to go hybrid since the drives I do make are often long distance. <\/p>\n\n<p>I also don\u2019t know how to approach our current car market.

Need something to keep skills up after passing. Car will mostly be used for going around London outskirts but also weekend trips to other places in the UK so it would be good to have something that is good with both city and motorway driving.

I had a 2005 Silverado in the past that I really liked but the newer ones with AFM seem unreliable from my online reading. A Ram 1500 with the V6 seems reasonably priced but I&#39;m wary of Dodge reliability. I like the F150 with the STX package (gives a center console) and the 2.7t but F150s seem the most expensive of the big 3. I know people like Tundras for reliability but they have abysmal mpg and poor interior features. Could an android auto capable head unit be easily added to a Tundra?<\/p>\n<\/div>","80":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[gel\u00f6scht]<\/p>\n<\/div>","81":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Is it risky to buy a 2012 bmw 118 tdi?<\/p>\n\n<p>It has had 4 private owners.<\/p>\n\n<p>First owner had it for one year.

Not sure if I can wait long enough to buy either, though. I could opt for a GTI, but I&#39;m not sure if the 2022 models are at dealerships yet. Similar story with the WRX: If the upcoming redesign is more comfortable with a nicer interior than the old one, I&#39;ll definitely put it on the list, but I may not be able to wait that long. The Civic Type R and Veloster N are both great, but the former is too pricey and the latter is too small. If I decided to ditch the manual-transmission, fun-to-drive side of things, I&#39;d just get an Accord Sport 2.0T and call it &quot;good enough.&quot;<\/p>\n<\/div>","85":"<div class=\"md\"><p>trying to decide between a Mazda cx-5, a Ford escape, which one should I go for?<\/p>\n<\/div>","86":"<div class=\"md\"><p>2018-19 Infinity Q50 AWD or Lexus ES 250 AWD?
