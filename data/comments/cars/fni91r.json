I know that it isn&#39;t what it was made for.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/imgur.com\/c21VOwC\">Pic of A8<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>Vehicles I&#39;ve already considered:\n1. 2011-2014 Audi A7 C7 3.0 BiTDI - 20,000 Euro - this was my first choice, but after test driving and checking quite a few examples, they all turned out to be badly taken care of or maybe they&#39;re not the most reliable options. I looked at 3.0 TFSI, but the fuel consumption is quite high. Lower than my current A8, which is about 15-20 litres per 100 km depending on how I drive. The 3.0 TDI is simply too slow.<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>2008-2009 CL500 4matic - 18,000 Euro - comfortable, big and roomy, lots of features, can run on LPG, which means lowering fuel costs by more than half. I was thinking about a CL63 AMG 4Matic, but maintenance on an AMG kinda scares me.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>2009-2013 E500 4Matic - 19,000 Euro - same as CL, but has 4 doors, because the coupes are impossible to find, newer than the CL, with a difference of up to 5 years for basically the same price. They offer the 2014 and up model with 20hp more, but can&#39;t run on LPG.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>BMW M550D XDrive - 23,000 Euro- this wasn&#39;t really something that I was thinking about, but I found a perfect example that has everything that I&#39;m looking for and even more with the only negative being that it&#39;s a wagon, but that could end up being useful. I did test drive a 535xd, but it seemed kinda boring.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>Do you need warranty: No, but would love a service history.<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do minor work on your vehicle: No.<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do major work on your vehicle: Major no.<\/p>\n\n<p>Additional notes: 24 year old, drives a lot - 30,000 km in the last 6 months. Drives fast most of the time, so preferably something that can handle it. I&#39;ve been looking at quite a few sport cars, but none of them really offer any comfortability within my price range. I&#39;ve been thinking about getting a comfortable SUV for regular driving and a sports car, but I don&#39;t have the money or time for 2 cars, so I need more of an all in one. I want a bi- or tri- turbodiesel or a big naturally aspirated V8 that can run on LPG in order to have fun, but still save a bit on fuel, because I drive a lot. The A7 seems the most obvious car to remove from the list due to not being the mostreliable and has very expensive parts, but it&#39;s extremely beautiful and comfortable. <\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m open to any other suggestions as long as the cars are not too expensive or hard to get in Europe, but still covers my must haves. I definitely don&#39;t want a big limousine again, but still a bit bigger car, so a midsize sedan or big coupes are okay.<\/p>\n\n<p>I definitely don&#39;t plan on doing anything to the car other than a remap if they&#39;re a diesel. <\/p>\n\n<p>Thank you in advance!<\/p>\n<\/div>","16":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[gel\u00f6scht]<\/p>\n<\/div>","17":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Hi everyone! <\/p>\n\n<p>This post is more for my dad rather than me. Both of us are into cool cars but not well versed in the technical side of things. He recently got a new job with a big salary increase and we are also moving to a cheaper location so he decided to want a new \u201ccheap-moderately expensive\u201d super car as it\u2019s been a dream of his to own one since his childhood. He mainly wants it for the cool factor but occasional racing (maybe once every month?) we\u2019ve eyed out a few possibilities but can\u2019t narrow it down. Any help from people with more knowledge is appreciated. He bought a Audi R8 V8 spyder 2014 model which we both share but it wasn\u2019t to our liking due to its grossly outdated features, so we could use that as part of a payment. It has roughly 14.5k miles and is worth about 75-85k. We\u2019d also prefer to get one with lower miles, around 30k at most to keep future mantainance problems to a minimum.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><ul>\n<li>USA(anywhere in country is fine)** (Specify your country or region)<\/li>\n<\/ul><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>70k-250k USD<\/strong> (Minimum-Maximum in your local currency)<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Buy<\/strong><\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>New or used: either is fine<\/strong><\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Type of vehicle:<\/strong> Sports Car, Racecar, SUV(something like the Urus)<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Must haves:<\/strong> Bluetooth, good exhaust, decent reliability<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Desired transmission:<\/strong> Automatic<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Intended use:<\/strong> Daily Driver, Weekend Car, Track Toy,<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered:<\/strong> <\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Mclaren 650s<\/p>\n\n<p>Audi R8 2017 model or later<\/p>\n\n<p>Lamborghini Hurrican<\/p>\n\n<p>Lamborghini Urus<\/p>\n\n<p>Acura NSX<\/p>\n\n<p>Mclaren mp4-12c<\/p>\n\n<p>Ferrari 458-488<\/p>\n\n<p>Lamborghini Aventedor<\/p>\n\n<p>Nissan GTR<\/p>\n\n<p>Mercedes AMG models<\/p>\n\n<p>Aston Martin db 11<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Is this your 1st vehicle:<\/strong> No, Currently own an Audi R8 2014, Dodge challenger r\/t 2019 and Cadillac Escalade 2015<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Do you need a Warranty:<\/strong> For used vehicles extended warranty is ok.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> (fluids, alternator, battery, brake pads etc) NO<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> (engine and transmission, timing belt\/chains, body work, suspension etc ) NO<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/blockquote>\n<\/div>","18":"<div class=\"md\"><ul>\n<li><p>Location: Ontario, Canada<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Price range: the lower, the better, but car needs to be somewhat long-lasting\/reliable<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Lease or Buy: Buy I guess<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>New or used: preferably new<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Looking for the best value car that has the following features:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>automatic braking<\/li>\n<li>automatic parking (automatic parallel park is only really needed one)<\/li>\n<li>climate control (doesn&#39;t have to be advanced or anything, just one that will turn off heating\/cooling once specific temperature is reached)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>","19":"<div class=\"md\"><ul>\n<li><strong>Location:<\/strong> Seattle, WA, US<\/li>\n<li><strong>Price range:<\/strong> ~$12k USD OOTD price<\/li>\n<li><strong>Lease or Buy:<\/strong> Buy<\/li>\n<li><strong>New or used:<\/strong> Used. ~$20k for new<\/li>\n<li><strong>Type of vehicle:<\/strong> Sedan pref, but open to hatchback\/hybrid<\/li>\n<li><strong>Must haves:<\/strong> Safety &gt; low maintenance &gt; fuel efficiency.
