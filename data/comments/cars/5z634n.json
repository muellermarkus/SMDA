I honestly love driving it but it&#39;s falling apart and I&#39;d like to try something else. Performance isn&#39;t very important to me, I&#39;m more concerned with reliability, safety, and honestly vanity. I&#39;d like something kind of fun and quirky like my xB. I also love driving the xB because of how high it sits and how huge the windows are, it&#39;s very easy to see all around you while driving. I&#39;ve never had any major reliability issues and that has been a huge comfort. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Location:<\/strong> Indianapolis, IN\n<strong>Price Range:<\/strong> Ideally less than 20k but I&#39;m flexible if I like the car enough\n<strong>New or used:<\/strong> No problem with new but I prefer used just for the price\n<strong>Type of vehicle:<\/strong> Just a car, most likely a coupe\/hatchback\/sedan\n<strong>Must haves:<\/strong> Decent window visibility, reliable, somewhat unique\n<strong>Intended use:<\/strong> Daily driver for a single male, mostly just driving to work or for the occasional road trip back home. \n<strong>Vehicles considered:<\/strong> I drove a <strong>Subaru BRZ<\/strong> and generally enjoyed it, although it was my first test drive and a very different driving experience to the xB. I think I liked it the most of anything I tested, but since it was my first drive I might not have appreciated it as much. I&#39;m generally a fan of the exterior and it had plenty of pickup for me. I like it but wasn&#39;t sure if I was really willing to drop 22,000 on a car yet. <\/p>\n\n<p>I also drove a <strong>Honda CRZ<\/strong> which I loved visually, inside and out, but thought it drove like shit. The handling was mushy and the back window visibility was awkward. I liked that it was a hybrid. <\/p>\n\n<p>My final test drive so far was a new <strong>Honda Civic Hatchback<\/strong> which once again I enjoyed visually but wasn&#39;t super sold on the driving experience. I really just think I need some time to get used to driving other cars, especially sedans and coupes that are much lower to the ground with limited visibility. I also need to get more comfortable with dropping a decent chunk of money on a car. I&#39;m really not on a strict budget but the cheapskate in me doesn&#39;t want to drop more than around 15k. <\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve considered all of the other box-cars, <strong>Honda Element<\/strong>, <strong>Kia Soul<\/strong>, <strong>Nissan Cube<\/strong>, and the newer <strong>xBs<\/strong> and might test drive some, although I&#39;m still thinking I&#39;d like to try something different if I can get excited about it. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Notes:<\/strong> This is not my first vehicle and the vehicle does not need to have a warranty. I can not do major or minor work on the vehicle.<\/p>\n\n<p>I just want a car with some personality than can reliably get me from A to B and isn&#39;t god-awful to drive. I think I&#39;ve been a little unfair to American cars by only considering Japanese and Korean to this point.

I have a huge hard-on for BMWs so if an E92 or E60 (preferably in 28i form) is an acceptable choice, I&#39;d be real happy! I&#39;m not sure what the situation&#39;s going to be for me in a few months, whether I might go off to the US for college or not. If I do end up staying however, I&#39;ll definitely need a car since I&#39;ll be attending college 2 hours away from home. If I stay I have the added benefit that my dad and I can handle most mechanical stuff. I won&#39;t name a budget quite yet because it&#39;s subject to change but under 25k USD is a good number.<\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ll consider non-German cars on an individual basis but I think Deutschland has me covered in terms of balancing luxury and sportiness. I want a stiffer car that I can still daily, it doesn&#39;t need to have a lot of power or tunability so non-turbo is preferred, but I strongly oppose 4 bangers so a V or (even better) I6 is strongly preferred (I5s are cool too, but besides Volvo I can&#39;t think of any cars that still have them). The interior doesn&#39;t need to have 11 million fancy gadgets or infotainment systems, a pair of comfortable leather seats and a solid build is more than satisfactory for me. I&#39;m only really familiar with BMWs but Audis are cool too in my book, particularly the quattro versions. My dad might have a panic attack if he ever sees 4 rings in his driveway again but that&#39;s a story for another day. Honorable mentions include the IS300 and the G37.<\/p>\n<\/div>","36":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I[Advice] Is this something any of you would even consider buying?<\/p>\n\n<p>I know the bad cosmetic upgrades and obviously fake seats and cheap rims makes one automatically assume this car was treated badly.\nThat&#39;s where most people would stop and not even consider the car.\nBut what if I hire a mechanic to check it out for me? what if anything that needs to be changed is not that expensive? the mileage is not high at all.\nAlso, the cosmetic stuff can easily be changed.

I searched but could not find anything. If need be, delete this comment but I could really use a bit of help, for what may be a simple problem. <\/p>\n\n<p>2003 Honda Accord, 141k miles, 4 cyl 2.4L<\/p>\n\n<p>One Saturday night a few weeks ago I was driving home from across town. Going about 75, at 2.5 rpm&#39;s roughly, my car makes a whizzing noise, the engine light comes on, and all of a sudden I can&#39;t take the rpm&#39;s past 3. Every time I do my car jerks forward like the tires are locked up. I still could drive, take it to 60, 65. I managed to drive the next 6 miles home, just keeping it slow and not gunning it. When I got to my house, I put it in park and revved it up to 1, 2 rpm&#39;s. once it got close to 3 the engine stopped accelerating and it wouldn&#39;t go any higher, just kept whirring like it was redlining at 3 rpm&#39;s. it was late, so I just went inside and decided to look at it the next morning. Of course, something came up and my brother took it to autozone for me to run a test. <\/p>\n\n<p>He didn&#39;t notice anything wrong with it. The same issue did not persist from the night before. He put some gas in it, got it half full, then drove around a bit. Still didn&#39;t notice anything, and then the engine light turned off. Well I figured maybe it was a one time thing, maybe it&#39;s fixed somehow. I monitored it carefully as I drove, driving slower and paying attention. Nothing seemed to be wrong at all after that one night, it was like a dream. <\/p>\n\n<p>Then last Monday, 11 days ago, I drove it across town again, still being cautious. On the freeway, going about 65-70, it starts to do this thing again. The rpm&#39;s went above 3 and the car did the same thing. So I got off the freeway and took the back roads and kept her slow. That&#39;s when I noticed the gas had gone down almost to where the gas light would be on. I remembered that&#39;s pretty much when it happens the first time too, when the gas had gotten to a certain low point. <\/p>\n\n<p>Since then, I have been away from home working on work projects, so I&#39;ve been in the work truck for the last 2 weeks. Well I&#39;m almost finished with the current job, and will need to work on my car to make sure I don&#39;t need any major work done. My only takeaway from familiar issues when this comes up is the gas level. Could it just be some sludge in my gas tank that is not allowing the gas to pass evenly after a certain point? I thought maybe when it&#39;s more full, the gas tank is heavy enough to keep pumping gas through, but maybe once it gets almost to empty, it just can&#39;t pump steady anymore. Is there perhaps an additive I could add during the dueling process that much flush out any blockage in my gas tank? <\/p>\n\n<p>I figured maybe some one or some of you here may have had this same problem and could offer a quick fix. Again, if there&#39;s somewhere more fitting for this post to be, please advise. I just didn&#39;t want to make a thread for one drivers odd problem. <\/p>\n<\/div>","108":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I was actually planning after doing some research to avoid the RX-8 because the engine is a lot of upkeep, but may I ask why to avoid the eclipse?
