STI does give me more capability to go out into the mountains and such but I rarely do that. M2 is super slick and nice and unlike other cars I&#39;ve owned but the warranty only has 1 year left. I only plan on driving it about 3k miles a year and the 2018 I&#39;m looking at has 5k currently. It&#39;s 56k out the door. Both seem to retain value decently.

I lean towards new -- after pricing them out, a new one would cost about $6,000 more than one of the used ones once you take into account probable shipping costs (I&#39;d like a cement tacoma and not many are available around me).
