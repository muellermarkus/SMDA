This was my first car, and I loved it for the most part. However, there&#39;s no way to kindly say this, it was slow as shit. Now, I don&#39;t desire a fast car by any means, I like to cruise around town with the windows down blasting music. However, I don&#39;t want a slow car either. The Dart had next to no acceleration, you could floor it and nothing would happen for about 3 seconds. The only other complaint I had about the Dart is that it was too small. I&#39;m 6&#39;2, and had to drive with my seat so far back, I comfortably stuck my arm out the back window when driving. <\/p>\n\n<p>I have been driving a 2016 Kia Soul rental this past week, and have been nothing but impressed.

Given that our cars are both 10+ years old going on 15 we don&#39;t have much of a gauge for what we should be looking for in a new car. We have gone to one dealer, but the rep didn&#39;t spend much time with us after the greeting so we weren&#39;t able to get much help there. Currently duel income with no kids, so we are looking to upgrade the civic with something fun\/nice but practical. Once this car is paid off we will look into replacing the outback with the intention of having at least one car with trunk space for moderate sized cargo.
