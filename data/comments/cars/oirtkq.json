Keeping my civic as my daily\/winter and to have the Fiero as a fun summer car.<\/p>\n\n<p>My parents and my brother disagree, they think I should sell my civic and buy something newer like a BRZ\/Civic SI that I can drive all year round, avoiding dumping money into older vehicles (Not that I don&#39;t have the money, they see it as a waste.<\/p>\n\n<p>Keep in mind, I live in Ontario Canada, so I need a car to take me from work to home, even if my work ends up being all the way up in Alliston Ontario.
