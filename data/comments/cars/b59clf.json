Looking for all the advice I can get when buying a used car such as things to look for, ask the owners, what cars are easy to maintain with out going to a garage, cars that have good mileage. We\u2019re planning on living in the car and touring for the year before we settle somewhere new. Any help and advice is welcome!

My questions are is the cost of maintenance high, how reliable are they (I heard that most import cars are very reliable), what type of problems should l looks for in these cars, are they practical enough to use as daily drivers, and any other input you have on this matter. I&#39;m leaning a bit towards the Maxima becuase it is $1400 cheaper and as it is not a luxury car I assume the cost to maintain it would not be too expensive as I&#39;m a college student and saving money can be often difficult.

My main concerns are reliability, ability to do well in inclement conditions, and utility. Wife would like a smooth ride and it to feel &quot;not old&quot;. I&#39;m partial to the Lexus GX, wife is partial to the highlander. Mileage and MPG are not super important to us. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<\/div>","73":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: NY<\/p>\n\n<p>Price range: Under 15,000<\/p>\n\n<p>Lease or Buy: Buy, but open to suggestions<\/p>\n\n<p>New or used: Either<\/p>\n\n<p>Type of vehicle: Sedan, Hatchback, Small SUV<\/p>\n\n<p>Must haves: Fuel efficient, Fun to drive, Reliable <\/p>\n\n<p>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc): Auto<\/p>\n\n<p>Intended use: Daily Driver (Commuter)<\/p>\n\n<p>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: Honda Civic, Toyota Corolla, Mazda 3, Subaru Legacy<\/p>\n\n<p>Is this your 1st vehicle: No<\/p>\n\n<p>Do you need a Warranty: Prefer<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle: Yes<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle: No<\/p>\n<\/div>","74":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Location:<\/strong> Georgia, USA  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Price range:<\/strong> US$0 - 24,000  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Lease or Buy:<\/strong> Buy  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>New or used:<\/strong> Used\/CPO  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Type of vehicle:<\/strong> Sedan  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Must haves:<\/strong> Comfortable for commute\/traffic, decently fast for the weekend, AWD preferred  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc):<\/strong> Auto  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Intended use:<\/strong> Daily Driver  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered:<\/strong> Stinger 2.0T, Optima SX, Sonata 2.0T  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Is this your 1st vehicle:<\/strong> No  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you need a Warranty:<\/strong> Yes  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> Yes  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> No  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Additional Notes:<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p>I am seeking user opinion on the 2017+ Fusion Sport V6.
