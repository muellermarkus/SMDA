Is it worth it being this old?<\/p>\n\n<p>If no is the answer, I love wagons, but currently the only options for a wagon is either really expensive, 35k and over, or nothing I&#39;m interested in.

The first being the 911 Turbo and then the Audi R8. Both of them can be found in the 75-80k range in my area. I&#39;m looking at the 997.1\/2 991 Turbos and the older generation R8, think 2009.<\/p>\n\n<p>Listed below is what I <em>think<\/em> to be true, please point out if I&#39;m wrong. <\/p>\n\n<p>R8 Pros:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Looks much better (imo).<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>More uncommon<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Listings are generally cheaper with less mileage <\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>911 Pros:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Much faster<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>More reliable? , Cheaper to maintain? <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Easier to live with<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>More listings, more choice<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>So I&#39;m going to test drive them tomorrow. If the 911 isn&#39;t a much funner drive, I&#39;d rather get the R8. <\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve heard time and time again that the 997 Turbo (911s in general) are very reliable and easy to live with sports cars. So I&#39;m not worried about their maintenance, or it breaking apart.<\/p>\n\n<p>My biggest concern with the R8 is that I have no idea what the reliability and maintenance of the R8 may look like. Its an Audi, how bad can it be right? I have a feeling that it will be a harder car to deal with due to the fact that its uncommon and seems more exotic than the 911. But I have no idea if that is true or not. <\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve also heard that the R8 is a pretty practical sports car aswell, but can it compare to the 911?<\/p>\n\n<p>Thanks guys.  <\/p>\n<\/div>","15":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[gel\u00f6scht]<\/p>\n<\/div>","16":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: Vancouver, Canada<\/p>\n\n<p>Price range: $10,000 or less<\/p>\n\n<p>New or used: Used<\/p>\n\n<p>Type of vehicle: Small-ish sedan, hatch or coupe (must have a decent size trunk)<\/p>\n\n<p>Must haves: Reliable, Manual Transmission, relatively fun to drive (I loved the mazda 3)<\/p>\n\n<p>Intended use: Daily Driver<\/p>\n\n<p>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: The smiley face Mazda 3, 2007+ Honda Civics, 2004-06 g35 <\/p>\n\n<p>Is this your 1st vehicle: No, I&#39;ve had a &#39;99 pathfinder (drove for 40k kms); manual &#39;05 Mazda 3 (drove for 30k kms); and I&#39;ve driven a number of pickup trucks for work (150s,350s, etc.)<\/p>\n\n<p>Does the vehicle need to have a warranty: No<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle: Yes<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle: No<\/p>\n\n<p>Additional Notes: I&#39;m graduating in May and am looking for a reliable vehicle for work.

Plus petro-spiritual life advice wanted.<\/p>\n\n<p>Hey gang! I currently daily a bare bones 2WD &#39;96 XJ. I&#39;m planning on replacing it in the next few months (so pre next gen Wrangler release, idk what that will do to the used market), and I&#39;ve narrowed the field down to a &#39;9-&#39;13 GM 1500, preferably with the 6.2 or a Wrangler JKU. I&#39;d be wanting 4x4 on both (huge regret on the XJ was not opting for 4x4), but for the most part would remain stock (new bumpers, audio, lights, that&#39;s about it). I am not a rock\/mall crawler, but I would be doing some mild offroading to camping spots while hauling camping gear and dirtbikes, particularly in the desert.<\/p>\n\n<p>The GM truck would obviously have gobs more power, and greater payload\/ towing capacity. I can tow a project\/not street legal 3,000 miles with ease in the truck (something I&#39;d do once or twice a year if I had the capability), wheres I&#39;m maxed out with camping gear and a dirt bike in the JKU. I love my dinosaur aged tractor 4.0 stupid simplicity and ease of maintenance (which there has been a lot of), but I really miss the pull and roar of my V8 (my car prior to the XJ was a &#39;90 Corvette). I know going with 12+ 3.6 nets me another 80HP, and the manual transmission makes either bearable, but that&#39;s still a good 135 hp\/ 150 lbft tq less than the truck (6.2 is the way I plan to go), which in turn is 1000lbs heavier.\nThis is a vehicle I s<\/p>\n\n<p>ee myself DD for at least 5 years. I have no doubts on the GM&#39;s reliability, and relatively low repair costs if an issue arises (here in Texas it&#39;s like every 4th car is a GM truck platform), how would a JKU stack against it? Other than head issues on that batch of 12\/13, most of the non-modification induced issues seem to be electrical\/computer glitching. My experience in the 12v industry has me convinced MOPAR\/FCA can&#39;t write vehicle software worth a shit, but objectively I don&#39;t know if the GM would be better\/worse.<\/p>\n\n<p>In a perfect world GM would have bought AMC, and I&#39;d be able to stroll down to the used GM lot and pick up a LS powered Eagle, Jeep, or shit a modern Blazer and be happy, but that&#39;s not the case and engine swaps are out of my budget. Either vehicle would be a compromise against the other.<\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve been in and around both extensively, gas consumption is the same, payments would be the same (25-26k total or less), insurance is the same, and they both seat 5 just fine (6.2 GM&#39;s pretty much all of center consoles). Jeep would be all about the topless, doorless, cruising life, but the truck gives me greater utility, donut output, and maximum penile compensation. Life&#39;s hard, throw me some info to help me make my mind up, and yes, I&#39;ve driven both (all autos though, again I&#39;d be going with the 6sp manual in the JKU).<\/p>\n<\/div>","31":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: Virginia, USA<\/p>\n\n<p>Max price 7k USD<\/p>\n\n<p>Used<\/p>\n\n<p>Must have manual transmission, RWD\/AWD<\/p>\n\n<p>Intended use: Daily<\/p>\n\n<p>Vehicles I&#39;m considering: Miata, MR2<\/p>\n\n<p>Third vehicle<\/p>\n\n<p>I can do minor work, but likely not major.<\/p>\n\n<p>My beloved Saturn might be toast, so I need to figure out a replacement.

Not sure what all the other Subarus use for a transmission. <\/p>\n<\/div>","55":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Trucks under 10k, open to paying less and fixing some stuff if it&#39;s worth it.<\/p>\n\n<p>Will be driving in Dallas TX, would purchase in SoCal or in Dallas.<\/p>\n\n<p>Wouldn&#39;t do maintenance on my own.<\/p>\n\n<p>Needs to be reliable, have the four door configuration, 4x4, v8, nice-ish looking interior.<\/p>\n\n<p>Don&#39;t know a ton about trucks, is there a common consensus on f-150&#39;s vs silverados around the years 2000-2006?

I have landed myself in a bit of a pickle. My wife and I had 1 &quot;Nice&quot; car (2012 Chevy sonic) and one older car left over from our college days (2007 Ford Taurus).

(we both have less than 10 mile per day commutes) and Drive the Taurus for a couple more years, then buy something cheaper<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Sell\/trade in the Taurus, and lease 2 cars or buy 2 used cars. obviously more expensive, but maybe we could work out a good deal? <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>sell\/trade in the Taurus, lease 1 cheaper car, buy one older (maybe 10-15k) car.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not sure if its worth it to try and get 2 at the same time for a deal, or if I should just get by with the Taurus and buy something else when it inevitably dies. we are still at the very early end of deciding anything, just exploring our options.

I am deciding on my next vehicle and I have it narrowed down to two.<\/p>\n\n<p>2015 Mazda CX-5 Grand Touring\n2015 Lincoln MKZ<\/p>\n\n<p>I know these are very different vehicles but I&#39;ve gone through a pros and cons and haven&#39;t gotten anywhere.  It will be my daily driver and I will also drive my wife and two sons at times. My sons are 3yo and 3mo. This means forward facing child seat and rear facing. <\/p>\n\n<p>I love the luxury and overall feel of driving the mkz. The turbo I4 doesn&#39;t seem to be under duress when you demand everything from it. I struggle with the fact I cannot swap out the stereo if I want better functionality since all of the cars electronics function through the sync head unit. I also am not a huge fan of the LED headlights and have no idea if I can retro in HIDs.<\/p>\n\n<p>On the CX5, the motor has less power but more configurability when it comes to the stereo and headlights. From a space standpoint, it has no problem either with the two child seats. It isn&#39;t bad to drive at all. Feels like a good move and logical move in terms of cost and some performance. <\/p>\n\n<p>Desires:\nLonger term reliability. I want to make this car last around 10 years or so. \nInexpensive parts and repairs. I can do a bunch of things myself but parts are parts. <\/p>\n\n<p>Based on Consumer reports reviews, the Mazda gets great marks for long term reliability but not the greatest in terms of customer satisfaction. The Lincoln has a level lower on reliability but greater marks for satisfaction. <\/p>\n\n<p>I would appreciate any insight into this.
