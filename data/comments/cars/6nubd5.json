My fiancee has a 2016 STI which I personally feel has the PERFECT seats. I love the way her car feels when I am driving. Its like I am in a warm embrace. It&#39;s also a lot lighter. I don&#39;t want two STI&#39;s in my driveway, so it&#39;s sorta out of the question. The MK7 Golf R is ugly as sin compared to, for example, the MK6. The Focus RS is beautiful, but the interior resembles a run of the mill rental car focus. I&#39;m worried I&#39;ll miss the V8 power but the STI is so much more fun to drive that I&#39;m thinking it&#39;s time for a change. <\/p>\n<\/div>","3":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[gel\u00f6scht]<\/p>\n<\/div>","4":"<div class=\"md\"><p><strong>Location:<\/strong> Vancouver<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Price range:<\/strong> 5k - 10k CAD<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>New or used:<\/strong> Used<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Type of vehicle:<\/strong> Coupe, sedan or hatchback<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Must haves:<\/strong> Reliable, fuel efficient, fun to drive<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Desired transmission:<\/strong> Manual<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Intended use:<\/strong> Daily driver<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered:<\/strong> Acura RSX, Toyota Celica, Honda Civic, Honda Fit, Toyota Yaris, Scion tC, Mazda MX-5<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Is this your 1st vehicle:<\/strong> Yes<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Does the vehicle need to have a warranty:<\/strong> No<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> No but I&#39;m willing to learn<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> No<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Additional Notes:<\/strong> I will be learning how to drive manual in this car.

I want to feel SOMETHING when driving other than beige monotony. The car needs to be able to fit a baby seat; I&#39;m okay with doing some circus manoeuvring to get into the car to deal with the baby, but the rear facing seat has to fit. <\/p>\n\n<p>The budget is fairly wide; I would prefer to spend less, but the other half says I should go upscale (I think she will change her mind when the payments are shown to her, but she is still pushing for it regardless). She things an M3 would be great, but I worry about the cost, along with the fact that the sound and interior don&#39;t do much for me. I used to have a WRX and it was horribly unreliable and the dealerships I dealt with were bad, so that&#39;s pretty much out. A Golf R would be a nice substitute, but I find the looks to be a bit too bland for me. The Focus RS looks great outside, but the inside is pretty poor looking (the Golf R and Focus RS should switch). <\/p>\n\n<p>I have my heart set on a Mustang GT or Camaro SS, but am concerned about the practicality. Winter driving I&#39;m not concerned about, though these cars in the Ontario winter won&#39;t be fantastic. I work primarily from home, so this is just my runabout car, and in the case of a blizzard, I will stay put. It&#39;s the baby seat question that is spoiling the dream. <\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m considering the new S4\/S5, as I think the AWD is nice, and the V6 is an okay compromise between the V8 I want, and the I4 that seems to come in every car that is &quot;practical&quot;. That legendary Audi reliability is a big question mark, and the value for money is...eh. <\/p>\n\n<p>Have I missed anything? Is there a car I should consider that I haven&#39;t, or can you offer your experience with using the Mustang\/Camaro as a baby mover? Thanks for your help folks. <\/p>\n<\/div>","14":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[gel\u00f6scht]<\/p>\n<\/div>","15":"<div class=\"md\"><ul>\n<li><p>Location: Netherlands<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Price range: max 44K euros<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>New<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Type of vehicle: Crossover\/SUV<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Must haves: radar, Diesel or hybrid, decent hp&#39;s, etc.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>automatic<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Daily driver<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Tucson, RAV4 and 3008<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>1st vehicle? no<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>yes<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>no<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>no<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>additional notes:<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Hi,<\/p>\n\n<p>So the company my father works at is finally allowing him to pick another car.
