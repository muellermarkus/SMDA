I work from home so in all likelihood it would not be a daily driver.

Leaning towards a pre-owned one as opposed to a new one since I&#39;d rather perform my rookie mistakes which would affect the car on a used one as opposed to a brand new one. I&#39;ve been driving rented cars about 3-4 times a month for the past 7-8 months (learnt to drive last year) - have enjoyed driving the Civic. Thinking about a CUV in case the extra space helps when I go out of town, camping, etc. Might sell the car in 2-3 years so resale value is important.<\/p>\n<\/div>","98":"<div class=\"md\"><p>\u2022 Location: The Netherlands<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Price Range: Maximum of 10k euro (11.2I usd)<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Lease or Buy: Buy<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 New or used: Used<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Type of vehicle: Family car<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Must haves: Fuel efficient, Trunk space.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc): manual<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Intended use: Family Car, Weekend Car<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: none seriously <\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Is this your 1st vehicle: yes<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Do you need a Warranty: required by law<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle: (fluids, alternator, battery, brake pads etc) no<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Can you do Major work on your own vehicle: (engine and transmission, timing belt\/chains, body work, suspension etc ) no<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Additional Notes:\nWe are looking to purchase a car for ourselves, with room for at least 2 possible kids and enough trunk space to bring a stroller. \nWe are also interested in hybrid\/electric vehicles, but the latter proves difficult because we want to have the option to go on a road trip.\nBut an electric motor is by no means a deal breaker.<\/p>\n<\/div>","99":"<div class=\"md\"><p><strong>Location:<\/strong> Central Indiana USA<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Price range:<\/strong> 30K-40K USD (Would like to stay in low 40s)<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Lease or Buy:<\/strong> Buy - we tend to keep our cars 5-10 years and put &gt; 100K miles on them<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>New or used:<\/strong> New or very low mileage 2019 or 2020 used<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Type of vehicle:<\/strong> This is where I&#39;m struggling.  Have had Subaru Outback LL Bean (2003-2013), Honda Pilot Touring (2014-present) for myself.  Given age of family (teens now able to drive themselves around), that we already have an Odyssey and Pilot for hauling people\/pets, and my commute\/work, I&#39;ve looked at 2-row SUVs (hybrid or regular), sedans (hybrid or regular), AWD wagons, and even 4Runner\/Tacoma for &quot;rugged fun.&quot;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Must haves:<\/strong> Biggest desire is reliability and longevity, as well as ability to get me to work 24\/7\/365 despite weather (although we don&#39;t get huge snows, usually 2-3 snow or ice &quot;storms&quot; in winter), and reasonable fuel economy. AWD would be &quot;nice&quot; but know that with good winter tires this isn&#39;t a &quot;need.&quot;  I usually like higher trim levels for climate control, leather and heated seats, auto mirrors, etc.  From reliability\/longevity standpoint, would prefer NA V6 over 4-cylinders\/turbos but can be convinced if I can be reassured that today&#39;s hybrid 4s and turbo 4s or 6s have good reliability.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc):<\/strong> Auto preferred for practical purposes (if wife or kids drive my car), but love manual transmissions for fun factor.  Would love to avoid CVT if possible.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Intended use:<\/strong> Daily driver - commute varies, as I work across 4 hospitals with drive time of 5 minutes 1-2 days\/month, 20 min commute 4-6 days\/month, and 45+ min commute 6-8 days\/month.  Also includes commutes 20-45 min 2-3 days\/month for admin meetings.

Sedans - Acura TLX, Lexus ES350\/300h, Audi A3\/A4, Accord (2.0 or Hybrid Touring), Camry V6, Avalon V6.  Wagon - Outback Limited, A4 Allroad.  Truck\/4X4 - Tacoma TRD dual cab, 4Runner TRD.  Of all the above, the only one I&#39;ve really driven is the Q5 - rented one from Silver Car in LA and loved most everything about it.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Is this your 1st vehicle:<\/strong> No - have driven mostly GM and Honda products since HS.  Outback was the only venture outside of these products.  No desire to go back to GM products.  Usually more comfortable with Japanese products due to long-standing quality\/reliability.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you need a Warranty:<\/strong> Typically have done extended warranty in past due to keeping cars for several years and putting &gt; 100K miles on our cars.
