SS has all the bells and whistles but it&#39;s pretty much out of my budget at the moment without some damned good negotiating (the only one I can afford is a 2014 with over 100k miles).

Which is why the idea of a BMW is scary. Although I&#39;ve talked to a mechanic who said his 1993 m3 isn&#39;t bad to work on. So the part costs are what scare me away from the 325i.<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle: See above.<\/p>\n\n<p>Sidenote: please don&#39;t comment with MX-5 and thats it.

But my reasons for Japanese is low costs and easy engines. My reasons for drifting are also deeper than watching initial D once. My grandfather used to take me racing. Drifting is an extension of that. Also have interest in rallying, but I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s as destructive as drifting.

It\u2019s tons of fun for me and my second Z car but it just doesn\u2019t excite me anymore like when I first bought it.  I\u2019m looking to sell either very late this year or early next year.  By that point I will have owned it just about 2 years.  I really want something nice and more practical than the Z but something that I can still have a bit of fun in!  I\u2019ve always liked turbo\u2019d Euro cars but I\u2019ve also heard many horror stories of things going wrong with them.  Although, not turbo\u2019d I used to own a MK4 VR6 and it was a pos.  I don\u2019t think it was cared for well before I got it but it still put a bad taste in my mouth.  Like if you get sick off of some bad sushi and then stay away from it for a while!  I\u2019m ready to jump back in and try another one but I\u2019m cautious.  I understand things go wrong no matter how well the car was cared for but overall reliability is quite important for me.  Anyway, I\u2019m open to domestic cars and other imports.  I\u2019m not planning on modding too heavy either.  Nice wheels, tires, coil overs, maybe an intake and exhaust and that will be about it if it even goes that far.  I\u2019ll also note that I travel a lot for work so I don\u2019t put tons of miles on my cars maybe about 8-10k miles\/year.  So shoot me some suggestions and any cars you may think I need to stay away from!  If you want more info just let me know.

Vacation car. <\/p>\n\n<p>Vehicles I&#39;ve considered: Had a 2014 mazda 3 and loved it (wish i had the 2.5 though) traded it for my wife an SUV. I&#39;ve consider and older 3 or an RX-8 (I&#39;m not afraid of the extra maintenance but worry about it not lasting) BMW E36 or E46. GTI. <\/p>\n\n<p>This is not my first vehicle<\/p>\n\n<p>I can do minor work but probably not a ton of major.

Is luxury vehicle something you want to consider given their higher maintenance costs and requirements of premium fuel? If you are not extremely tempted on luxury, I would skip the C class and the A3 for maintenance cost and repair bill reasons. The Subaru WRX is a sportier Impreza, but did not continues to be produced with the previous gen bodystyle. It is an enthusiast&#39;s car and pretty well respected in the car community. It also comes in both auto and manual. Impreza and the Civic are the more &quot;affordable&quot; choices in the list, but these vehicles do also top out around $30-35k if fully loaded. The main difference between these would be the AWD vs FWD. So the question you want to ask yourself is;\n1. Is luxury a must? If not, skip the C Class and A3\n2. How sporty do I want my car to be? If sporty, choose WRX, if you care more about fuel efficiency, go with Impreza or better Civic\n3. Do I need AWD? or can I live with FWD? If needed, stay Subaru, if not Civic is still a good choice\n4. Do I really want manual? (WRX, Impreza, and Civic can all be had with a manual)<\/p>\n<\/div>"},"comment_toplevel":{"0":1,"1":1,"2":1,"3":1,"4":1,"5":1,"6":1,"7":1,"8":1,"9":1,"10":1,"11":1,"12":1,"13":1,"14":1,"15":1,"16":1,"17":1,"18":1,"19":1,"20":1,"21":1,"22":1,"23":1,"24":1,"25":1,"26":1,"27":1,"28":1,"29":1,"30":1,"31":1,"32":1,"33":1,"34":1,"35":1,"36":1,"37":1,"38":1,"39":1,"40":1,"41":1,"42":1,"43":1,"44":1,"45":1,"46":1,"47":1,"48":1,"49":1,"50":1,"51":1,"52":1,"53":1,"54":1,"55":1,"56":1,"57":1,"58":1,"59":1,"60":1,"61":1,"62":1,"63":1,"64":1,"65":1,"66":1,"67":1,"68":1,"69":1,"70":1,"71":1,"72":1,"73":1,"74":1,"75":1,"76":1,"77":1,"78":1,"79":1,"80":1,"81":1,"82":1,"83":1,"84":1,"85":1,"86":1,"87":1,"88":1,"89":1,"90":1,"91":1,"92":1,"93":1,"94":1,"95":1,"96":1,"97":1,"98":1,"99":1,"100":1,"101":1,"102":1,"103":1,"104":1,"105":1,"106":1,"107":1,"108":1,"109":1,"110":1,"111":1,"112":1},"comment_distinguished":{"0":null,"1":null,"2":null,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null,"7":null,"8":null,"9":null,"10":null,"11":null,"12":null,"13":null,"14":null,"15":null,"16":null,"17":null,"18":null,"19":null,"20":null,"21":null,"22":null,"23":null,"24":null,"25":null,"26":null,"27":null,"28":null,"29":null,"30":null,"31":null,"32":null,"33":null,"34":null,"35":null,"36":null,"37":null,"38":null,"39":null,"40":null,"41":null,"42":null,"43":null,"44":null,"45":null,"46":null,"47":null,"48":null,"49":null,"50":null,"51":null,"52":null,"53":null,"54":null,"55":null,"56":null,"57":null,"58":null,"59":null,"60":null,"61":null,"62":null,"63":null,"64":null,"65":null,"66":null,"67":null,"68":null,"69":null,"70":null,"71":null,"72":null,"73":null,"74":null,"75":null,"76":null,"77":null,"78":null,"79":null,"80":null,"81":null,"82":null,"83":null,"84":null,"85":null,"86":null,"87":null,"88":null,"89":null,"90":null,"91":null,"92":null,"93":null,"94":null,"95":null,"96":null,"97":null,"98":null,"99":null,"100":null,"101":null,"102":null,"103":null,"104":null,"105":null,"106":null,"107":null,"108":null,"109":null,"110":null,"111":null,"112":null},"comment_edited":{"0":false,"1":false,"2":false,"3":false,"4":1501523031.0,"5":false,"6":1501523342.0,"7":false,"8":false,"9":false,"10":false,"11":false,"12":1501651899.0,"13":false,"14":false,"15":false,"16":false,"17":false,"18":false,"19":false,"20":false,"21":false,"22":false,"23":false,"24":false,"25":1501733204.0,"26":false,"27":false,"28":false,"29":false,"30":false,"31":false,"32":false,"33":false,"34":false,"35":false,"36":false,"37":false,"38":false,"39":false,"40":false,"41":false,"42":false,"43":false,"44":false,"45":false,"46":false,"47":false,"48":false,"49":false,"50":false,"51":false,"52":false,"53":false,"54":false,"55":false,"56":false,"57":false,"58":false,"59":1501620801.0,"60":false,"61":1501621950.0,"62":false,"63":false,"64":false,"65":false,"66":false,"67":false,"68":false,"69":false,"70":false,"71":false,"72":false,"73":false,"74":false,"75":false,"76":false,"77":false,"78":false,"79":1501851271.0,"80":false,"81":false,"82":1501862198.0,"83":false,"84":false,"85":false,"86":false,"87":false,"88":false,"89":false,"90":false,"91":false,"92":false,"93":false,"94":1502002041.0,"95":false,"96":false,"97":false,"98":false,"99":false,"100":1502058017.0,"101":false,"102":false,"103":false,"104":false,"105":false,"106":false,"107":false,"108":false,"109":false,"110":1506099617.0,"111":false,"112":false},"comment_is_submitter":{"0":false,"1":false,"2":false,"3":false,"4":false,"5":false,"6":false,"7":false,"8":false,"9":false,"10":false,"11":false,"12":false,"13":false,"14":false,"15":false,"16":false,"17":false,"18":false,"19":false,"20":false,"21":false,"22":false,"23":false,"24":false,"25":false,"26":false,"27":false,"28":false,"29":false,"30":false,"31":false,"32":false,"33":false,"34":false,"35":false,"36":false,"37":false,"38":false,"39":false,"40":false,"41":false,"42":false,"43":false,"44":false,"45":false,"46":false,"47":false,"48":false,"49":false,"50":false,"51":false,"52":false,"53":false,"54":false,"55":false,"56":false,"57":false,"58":false,"59":false,"60":false,"61":false,"62":false,"63":false,"64":false,"65":false,"66":false,"67":false,"68":false,"69":false,"70":false,"71":false,"72":false,"73":false,"74":false,"75":false,"76":false,"77":false,"78":false,"79":false,"80":false,"81":false,"82":false,"83":false,"84":false,"85":false,"86":false,"87":false,"88":false,"89":false,"90":false,"91":false,"92":false,"93":false,"94":false,"95":false,"96":false,"97":false,"98":false,"99":false,"100":false,"101":false,"102":false,"103":false,"104":false,"105":false,"106":false,"107":false,"108":false,"109":false,"110":false,"111":false,"112":false},"comment_score":{"0":19,"1":11,"2":8,"3":7,"4":6,"5":8,"6":4,"7":3,"8":4,"9":3,"10":5,"11":3,"12":3,"13":3,"14":3,"15":3,"16":2,"17":2,"18":2,"19":2,"20":2,"21":2,"22":2,"23":2,"24":2,"25":2,"26":2,"27":2,"28":2,"29":2,"30":2,"31":2,"32":2,"33":2,"34":2,"35":2,"36":2,"37":1,"38":1,"39":1,"40":1,"41":1,"42":1,"43":1,"44":1,"45":1,"46":1,"47":1,"48":1,"49":1,"50":1,"51":1,"52":1,"53":1,"5
