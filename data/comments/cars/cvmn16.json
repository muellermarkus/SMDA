Not a fan of the CRV and Foresters are pretty heavily marked up here because rich boomers love them. I&#39;ve narrowed it down to the following options and really just need to weigh the value of cost vs mileage and see which dealer is willing to play ball on price. The list prices reflect mileage and trim options pretty nicely, showing over $1000k jumps. Most expensive to least expensive:<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>2016 Cx-5 GS around 55k<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>2014 Rav4 XLE around 100k<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>2014 Rav4 LE around 70k<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>2015 Rav4 XLE around 160k - bonus: has roof rack and trailer hitch<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>2014 Rav4 LE around 120k - bonus: is black :) and comes with winter times on steelies<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>2016 Cx-5 GS around 170k - bonus: has roof rack and trailer hitch, 2 years of warranty left<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>extra: 2016 Cx-5 GS around 100k with no list price yet<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Age is definitely a big factor here due to rust so the Cx-5s have the edge there. The Rav4s are significantly cheaper though due to age and higher mileage. Toyota&#39;s aren&#39;t really phased by mileage either if they have been maintained half-decently. I have a Corolla right now and I plan to drive it to 300k+. Drove my 4Runner before that to 320k before rust got to it. Not sure if I would feel as confident in the long-term reliability of the Mazda drivetrain. I&#39;m also weary to invest nearly 20k into a Mazda. My family is very hard on cars so they depreciate in value very fast in our ownership. <\/p>\n\n<p>The Rav4s have the Camry 4 cylinder and Highlander trans so it&#39;s pretty bombproof and well proven. The rugged utilitarian design of Toyotas is also attractive to me. You can add some bolt on parts and get their tow rating up to par with EU and AU too which is nice. They also all have at least roof rack rails, which makes adding crossbars cheap and easy.<\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m also concerned by the two CUVs that already have high mileage and tow hitches. It could be a clue that the trans is worn. There&#39;s no way of knowing what was towed, how often, and how well.<\/p>\n\n<p>Any thoughts or insight?<\/p>\n<\/div>","63":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: Toronto, Canada<\/p>\n\n<p>Price range: $90000 CAD<\/p>\n\n<p>Lease or Buy: Probably buy?

Of the three cars I have listed, 1 was recently revealed (Corvette), 1 basically has been revealed with some exceptions (Porsche Taycan), the last has only been seen on the Nurburgring (F Type Facelift). So normally this would be too early to post this, but apparently Corvette reservation is $5,000 and once the car starts being built (he told me in October) my reservation is no longer refundable.<\/p>\n\n<p>So the Corvette is really beautiful (front over rear) and interior is also really nice. The Porsche packs the latest technology, is a luxury sedan, but looks more &#39;flat&#39; compared to the others and will be relatively expensive to lease. The Jaguar we know next to nothing about but history shows it will look &amp; sound amazing, and technology will be up there as well, but will be more expensive than the Corvette. <\/p>\n\n<p>This is of course highly speculative, but just wanted to hear other opinions before I give a $5,000 deposit (as apparently reservations are filling up).<\/p>\n<\/div>","85":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: New Zealand<\/p>\n\n<p>Price range: 70,000 NZD<\/p>\n\n<p>Lease or Buy: Buy<\/p>\n\n<p>New or used: Either<\/p>\n\n<p>Type of vehicle: Sports Car<\/p>\n\n<p>Must haves: Android Auto<\/p>\n\n<p>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc): Either DSG or Manual<\/p>\n\n<p>Intended use: Daily Driver, Country road weekend fun driver<\/p>\n\n<p>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: Civic Type R, Golf R<\/p>\n\n<p>Is this your 1st vehicle: No<\/p>\n\n<p>Do you need a Warranty: No <\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle: (fluids, alternator, battery, brake pads etc) Yes<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle: (engine and transmission, timing belt\/chains, body work, suspension etc ): No<\/p>\n\n<p>Additional Notes: I haven&#39;t test driven a Toyota 86 or 370z but they&#39;d be some stuff i&#39;d consider too. 2 door things r cool<\/p>\n<\/div>","86":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Guys I&#39;m in uk and looking to buy a face-lift Volvo C30 1.6 diesel manual R design (30\u00a3 road tax ftw) any C30 owner that can tell me what to look for and if the car is worthy?<\/p>\n<\/div>","87":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Location:<\/strong> Southern U.S  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Price range:<\/strong> 20,000- 28,000 or a little over  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Lease or Buy:<\/strong> Buy  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>New or used:<\/strong> Used  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Type of vehicle:<\/strong> 2018 Ford Mustang  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Must haves:<\/strong> V6 or V8  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc):<\/strong> Manual  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Intended use:<\/strong> Every day car and sometimes track  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered:<\/strong> Corvette, Audi TT and Camaro  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Is this your 1st vehicle:<\/strong> Yes  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you need a Warranty:<\/strong> No  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> Yes  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> Yes<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<\/div>","88":"<div class=\"md\"><p><strong>Location:<\/strong>  Maryland, around DC (&quot;DMV&quot;)<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Price range:<\/strong> &lt;$20k USD<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Lease or Buy:<\/strong> Buy<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>New or used:<\/strong> Strong preference on new, if not certified used.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Type of vehicle:<\/strong> Doesn&#39;t matter<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Must haves:<\/strong> Leather Seats, AWD<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc):<\/strong> Auto<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Intended use:<\/strong> Daily<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered:<\/strong> Too many not sure what to look at<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Is this your 1st vehicle:<\/strong> No<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you need a Warranty:<\/strong> Yes<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> No<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> No<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Additional Notes:<\/strong> This car is for my mom.

Was interested in that until I saw the Engine I wanted probably would bring me over $30K, which was a little less appealing.  This would be parked on the street and need to be able to get through snow.  We ski too so AWD is a must.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated!<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<\/div>","108":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[gel\u00f6scht]<\/p>\n<\/div>","109":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Currently in the market for a 2010-2013 smaller sedan.

The C8 looks like it will offer supercar-like performance for a much cheaper price. The Taycan could potentially blow Tesla out of the water at its own game. And the F Type is already one of the most gorgeous cars on the road, so I can only imagine the facelift will make things even better. But a lot can change between now and the release dates for these cars.<\/p>\n\n<p>Sure, the C8 will be super hot for the first year or so it&#39;s released. After that, the hype will die down and you won&#39;t need to be on a waitlist to get one. In a few years, C8 exclusivity will be a thing of the past. Personally, I think it&#39;s likely the C8 will be the best sports car for the money when it&#39;s released. But if you&#39;re not willing to commit to it, then $5000 is a lot for a deposit.<\/p>\n\n<p>I wouldn&#39;t be signing up for any of these right now. Not until we have a lot more to go on.
