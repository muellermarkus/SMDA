This is more a dream car scenario though, I put together a Carvana budget and getting this with around 38k miles with tax\/title ect and the carvana care warranty for it&#39;s max (60 months\/100k miles) would net to around 20k.

Of course the current internal debate is &quot;will these CVT complaints haunt me over the next 4 years?&quot;<\/p>\n\n<p>Now ultimately, if I can be convined I would be able to lease over the next 4 years and ideally save money, I&#39;d rather that route, but I&#39;ve never leased before so I don&#39;t have a true frame of reference.<\/p>\n<\/div>","5":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: Canada<\/p>\n\n<p>Price range: 10-15k CAD<\/p>\n\n<p>Lease or Buy: Buy<\/p>\n\n<p>New or used: Used<\/p>\n\n<p>Type of vehicle: SUV, Wagon<\/p>\n\n<p>Must haves: AWD<\/p>\n\n<p>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc): Auto<\/p>\n\n<p>Intended use: Daily Driver\/ Family Car<\/p>\n\n<p>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: Toyota Rav 4, Honda CR-V<\/p>\n\n<p>Is this your 1st vehicle: Yes<\/p>\n\n<p>Do you need a Warranty: No<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle: Yes<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle: No<\/p>\n\n<p>Additional Notes: Looking for our 1st family car, looking for something reliable that will last if taken care of.

If you love this car, treat it well with good oil and filter, drive the fuck out of it, and also have fun on the weekends. With the money saved (maintenance, insurance, space etcetc...) , you can get another accrod down the line or better yet, you probably have grown enough to get a proper sports car in 5-10 years like a
