We have 2 dogs and cleaning leather seats is easier than cloth.<\/p>\n\n<p>I am now 100% remote for work permanently so the car may not be driven every day or it may be driven as little as 20 miles per day. There will be an occasional load of bagged mulch or soil or a restock from the warehouse club so seats that fold down are nice. <\/p>\n\n<p>We&#39;ve recently returned to the US and the cold harsh winters of Western NY and my first instinct is to get a Subaru because despite any faults they handle the winters up here w\/o a problem but the American car market offerings are overwhelming and I felt like we rushed to buy the CRV and Kia when we arrived back in the USA and needed 2 cars almost immediately. Now I have more time to make a decision and work situations have changed.<\/p>\n\n<p>We can charge an EV at home so we&#39;re open to an EV but unfamiliar with what is out there. We are open to a hybrid too.

I really want a wagon\/4 door hatch back for the utility. I test drove an Outback today. I loved the car, but the engine was terrible compared to my Lexus. I&#39;m currently trying to find a Touring XT to compare it to, but I&#39;m having trouble finding luxury wagons that aren&#39;t outrageously priced. My ES was like 26K used, but I can&#39;t find a wagon for double that with a comparable engine a decade later?

I just want to know witch one&#39;s the best both in sense of it&#39;s being easier to work on and lasting a long time, and having cheap parts.  right now I&#39;m most likely to get the celica unless there&#39;s a reason to get mr2 instead for some big mechanical issue they have the same engine after all so I&#39;&#39;d get ether.  also anyway to fix the blowing up on high speed turns issue of the late model celicas, also do the 2000 and later mr2 spiders have that issue as well, the engine placement might affect it? I mostly just care about cheapest repairs in the long run. This will be my main car until I get a truck when I move to the desert. I don&#39;t care about snap oversteer or anything but the difference in parts cost and frequency of rears needed by each of these total cost not including insurance and purchase cost are main concern.<\/p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>celica gt 4th gen<\/li>\n<li>celica gt 5th gen<\/li>\n<li>celica gt 6th gen<\/li>\n<li>celica gt 7th gen<\/li>\n<li>mr2 base 2d gen<\/li>\n<li>mr2 base thrid gen<\/li>\n<li>supra base 2d gen<\/li>\n<li>supra base 3rd gen<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>","13":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Location:<\/strong> Southeast USA<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Price range:<\/strong> 25k-35k<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Lease or Buy:<\/strong> buy<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>New or used:<\/strong> prefer new but wouldn\u2019t mind used<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Type of vehicle:<\/strong> car, sedan, hatchback <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Must haves:<\/strong> drives well, fast, sounds and looks good <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc):<\/strong> doesn\u2019t matter<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Intended use:<\/strong> autocross, for fun. <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered:<\/strong> Hyundai Veloster N, Volkswagen GTI, and Ford Focus RS<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Is this your 1st vehicle:<\/strong> No, my first and current is a 2014 Jeep Compass. <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Do you need a Warranty:<\/strong> I would like one. <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> No but my friends can teach me. <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> No.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/blockquote>\n<\/div>","14":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: Canada BC<\/p>\n\n<p>Price range: 7K<\/p>\n\n<p>Buy<\/p>\n\n<p>Used<\/p>\n\n<p>Type of vehicle: car<\/p>\n\n<p>Must haves: more than 240 HP<\/p>\n\n<p>Transmission: Manual<\/p>\n\n<p>Intended use: daily <\/p>\n\n<p>Vehicles I have considered: 2007 Honda Accord v6 240 hp<\/p>\n\n<p>1st v\u00e9hicule: no<\/p>\n\n<p>Warranty: no<\/p>\n\n<p>Minor work: yes<\/p>\n\n<p>Major: somewhat<\/p>\n<\/div>","15":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Question about an car buying opportunity for my elderly parents.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Location:<\/strong> Kansas City, MO, USA<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>New or used:<\/strong> used<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Type of vehicle:<\/strong> Sedan<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc):<\/strong> auto<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Intended use:<\/strong> Daily Driver<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> I can do minor stuff for them<\/p>\n\n<p>My elderly parents currently drive a 2006 Mazda 6 that has 140k on it.
