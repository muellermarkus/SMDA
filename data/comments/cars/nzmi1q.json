I really like the styling and overall package of the vehicle, and since the model is selling poorly I see most dealers listing them significantly below MSRP. The Kia warranty is also a huge draw.

Current lease payments+residual value should I decide to buy it total ~$29,000. A local dealer has offered me $40,600 for it. As much as I like the car, it seems silly not to look into other options since at this price I will end up making a decent profit off the 3-year lease. The issue I have is, where to go from here. <\/p>\n\n<p>My thought process: The kia will end up with a loan of ~27,500 at 5%+ APR leaving the total paid ~31,000+. A new car even at the top of the budget 45k (minus ~10k I would get back from the kia) would end up with a loan of 35,000 at 1-2% APR for a total cost of ~36,000. The only way the Mach-E fits into this equation is the 7,500 tax credit and even then it&#39;s a bit on the high side. There are also a lot of unknowns around the GT other than it might be around this fall. But will any be available to purchase off the lot or is that more of a next year deal? I can go without a car for a while, I can drive my company car in the meantime but I don&#39;t know that I want to do that for an undetermined length of time.<\/p>\n<\/div>","18":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Currently drive 25 year old Ford truck.

And so I did a test drive today of an Audi Q5 (2021).

Like I honestly pretty much wouldn\u2019t be able to tell you when it actually shifts gears! Obviously that\u2019s not surprising when it is operating in electric mode but I am talking about when powered by the gasoline engine too.<\/p>\n\n<p>In the Audi Q5 that was a totally different feeling to me. It felt very obvious whenever the transmission shifted up\/down. Not the smoothness I\u2019m used to.<\/p>\n\n<p>I have not driven very many automatics in my life (my background is a place where automatics is not the default) but to me the Audi felt almost like what I remember automatics felt like many years ago. Surely a little smother but not a ton. <\/p>\n\n<p>On to the actual question: <\/p>\n\n<p>Can anyone explain what\u2019s going on in those two different vehicles? Does it somehow have any relation to the hybrid\/non-hybrid (maybe the Q5 plug-in hybrid is similar to the RAV4 Hyrbid experience?)\u2026. Or should I be looking at a different power train\/transmission type on the Audi to get a similar experience out of the automatic transmission\u2026 Or is that simply just how that car make\/model is? if so I am really curious what is the cause for this huge difference is?<\/p>\n\n<p>Possibly relevant: I\u2019m located in the US.
