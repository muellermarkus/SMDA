I&#39;ll be giving up my Fiesta ST. My wife has said that if we ship her car, then she doesn&#39;t care what I buy. So, I&#39;ve been doing some &quot;window shopping&quot; looking through car classifieds and getting ideas.<\/p>\n\n<p>I view this as my opportunity to buy a cool Euro car that we can&#39;t get in the US.

Ideally, I would be able to use the car for weekly 100 km round trip drives into Budapest.<\/p>\n\n<p>Some ideas that have crossed my mind--<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Seat Leon FR: Either the 170 HP TDI or the 200 HP petrol. The TDI will chip to 227 HP while the petrol will go to 255. I think it&#39;s probably worth giving up 20 HP for the extra efficiency, torque, and cool factor. There&#39;s a bright yellow one for sale right now that looks fucking badass.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Honda Civic Mk8 2.2 CTDi: Will apparently go up to 200 HP with a chip. Weighs a little bit less than the Leon. I love the styling on the Euro Mk8.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Renault Megane 2.0 DCi: I don&#39;t know too much about these, but the 2.0 DCi will apparently go to 220 HP with a chip. Could be fun.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Peugeot 206 1.6 HDI or 2.0 HDI: The 1.6 can be chipped to 140 HP and 200+ torques, while the 2.0 will go to ~155 HP with an intercooler, boost controller, and chip. I like the light weight-- like 2200 lbs. Larger brakes from the 306 and 406 can be swapped on. Replace the wheels with slightly large ones and lower profile tires. Maybe add a propane kit. Could be a fun little car.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>I would love to hear more suggestions or feedback on any of the ones I&#39;ve mentioned above.<\/p>\n<\/div>","36":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[gel\u00f6scht]<\/p>\n<\/div>","37":"<div class=\"md\"><p><strong>Location:<\/strong> Dubai, UAE<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Price range:<\/strong> 30-40k UAE dirhams<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Lease or Buy:<\/strong> Both options are fine<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>New or used:<\/strong> Used, CPO<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Type of vehicle:<\/strong> Hatch or a sedan<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Must haves:<\/strong> Cool AC, radio I can hook my phone up to.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc):<\/strong> Auto<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Intended use:<\/strong> Daily<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered:<\/strong> 2014 Honda Jazz\/Fit, the 2018 model of the same, 99&#39; Mitsubishi Galant<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Is this your 1st vehicle: Yes<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you need a Warranty: Yes<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> (fluids, alternator, battery, brake pads etc): No but I wanna learn<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> (engine and transmission, timing belt\/chains, body work, suspension etc ) No but I wanna learn<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Additional Notes:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>I just got my licence a month back and I&#39;m in the process of buying a certified pre-owned car from the dealership (at the suggestion of my folks).

We\u2019ve been looking at the current gen Nissan Maxima. We\u2019re looking at a used 2017 Maxima with 45k miles that\u2019s on sale at Hertz for ~$18,500. This is the best deal we\u2019ve found for a used Maxima near us besides a CarMax offering that\u2019s a 2016 with 32k miles, but it was also a former rental car just like the Hertz version.<\/p>\n\n<p>Any suggestions on what to do? Should we try out the Maxima, even if it was a former rental?<\/p>\n\n<p>My wife\u2019s current car is a 2006 Toyota Matrix with 190k miles, and it was a former rental as well. It\u2019s got multiple issues that are requiring repairs that\u2019ll cost us upwards of $2500, and even though I\u2019m sure it\u2019d be financially smarter to just get the repairs done, my wife deserves something nice after years of driving this Matrix and never asking me for anything materialistic. I want to get her something she loves and the Maxima is it, chief.<\/p>\n<\/div>","74":"<div class=\"md\"><p><strong>Location<\/strong>: California, USA  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Price range<\/strong>: $10k-$30k USD  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Lease or Buy<\/strong>: Buy  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>New or used<\/strong>: CPO or New  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Type of vehicle<\/strong>: Sedan  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Must haves<\/strong>: Decent fuel efficiency, 4 cylinder engine, smooth ride, spacious interior, attractive looking car (subjective I know, but we can all tell when a car is probably ugly to most people lol)      <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc)<\/strong>: Automatic  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Intended use<\/strong>: Daily driver, possible family car (although I dont plan on having kids for at least 5+ years).

My previous car was a 2000 Honda Civic which I had bought when I was 15 from a private seller.

Really not sure which one to go with, as I am in love with the looks and performance of the BMW, but I find the Accord to be very comfortable and something I could envision having for 5-10 years, and would be something I&#39;d hope to have running relatively smoothly even when I do start to raise a family 5+ years down the road. I&#39;m not so sure that the BMW would be something I could count on having that long, as I&#39;d be scared of repair costs outside of the warranty period.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Overall, I would be fine with the Accord, although I don&#39;t think it looks that great on the outside. The interior is very spacious, which is nice. My mind would be at ease a little bit more seeing as how Hondas are perceived to be more reliable and require less preventative maintenance than the 320i would. But at the same time, every time I see a white 3 series BMW I just fall in love. I&#39;m conflicted on what to do.  <\/p>\n\n<p>For what it&#39;s worth, my situation is that I&#39;m 25 years old, single, living in the Bay Area CA, and making about $63k a year living with mom and dad who refuse to accept rent from me. Currently paying off $46k of student loans which I now have down to $13k, so the payments are very manageable.   <\/p>\n\n<p>Also if anyone has any experience buying a CPO BMW I&#39;d be very curious how maintenance and repairs have been for you. I&#39;m unfamiliar with the reliability of the 2017\/2018 3 series (N20 engine). I know the car is new so issues shouldn&#39;t be coming up too soon per se, but I&#39;m mostly just looking for some guidance from someone with experience who can speak on these qualms I&#39;ve having. I know the 320i may be gutless to BMW enthusiasts but I really think it&#39;d be enough for me as I like the style and smoothness of it. Don&#39;t forget that I&#39;m literally coming from a 2000 Honda Civic. Really appreciate any thoughts.
