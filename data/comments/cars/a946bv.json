I&#39;m trying to decide between a 2018-2019 Civic Type R and a 2019 Impreza WRX STi. I like the interior and &#39;old school&#39; feel of the Impreza, but that EJ257 gives me pause. I do have to commute a moderate amount for work, and the fuel economy of the Impreza is less than impressive. On the other hand, the Type R engine feels so much more versatile and fuel economy is better. The Type R weighs about 300-350lbs less and the handling balance is more neutral. I don&#39;t mind FWD (Living in Florida allows for me to not worry about Winter tires either)  <\/p>\n\n<p>Styling is not great on either car, but that doesn&#39;t matter as much to me. The shifter placement is much better in the Type R, and shift feel for both is different but fantastic in their own way.  <\/p>\n\n<p>How much more comfortable would the CTR be for longer drives? I know it beats the snot out of the RS with regards to ride quality, but is the STi pretty comfy for 60-90 minute commutes?  <\/p>\n\n<p>Also, dealer markup on the CTR is both hilarious and offensive, but I&#39;m haggling with a dealership that might come down to a sane price for a FWD hatchback. The Impreza can be had for less than sticker (looking at a base STi, as it weighs the least)  <\/p>\n\n<p>Am I crazy to want the CTR over the STi, or am I being too hard on the STi&#39;s powerplant?  <\/p>\n\n<p>If anybody who owns either car would chime in, your personal experience would be greatly appreciated.<\/p>\n<\/div>","1":"<div class=\"md\"><p>\u2022 Location: Dallas, Texas\n \u2022 Price range: 30k-50k\n \u2022 Lease or Buy: prefer to buy due to high mileage use, more than 10k a year\n \u2022 New or used: used \n \u2022 Type of vehicle: sedan\n \u2022 Must haves: power. \n \u2022 Desired transmission either\n \u2022 Intended use: daily driver\n \u2022 Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: Stinger, S4\n \u2022 Is this your 1st vehicle: nope\n \u2022 Do you need a Warranty: nope\n \u2022 Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle: yes\n \u2022 Can you do Major work on your own vehicle: partial\n \u2022 Additional Notes: I want something in the 350 horsepower range.

I may like the WRX best in terms of appearance and uniqueness, but the interior is super dated and there is the head gasket thing. I really like the RS but feel it may be too absurd and perhaps is not worth it, though it also may hold its value and therefore be worth it later anyways. I&#39;ve never thought too much of the ST, but it is essentially the reasonable RS from what I know. Many of my contemplations and research land me on the GTI.  It is a lot of fun, has the best interior by miles, has far superior fuel economy (I commute about 30 miles), but also is less exciting in the looks department(though I still think they are cool).<\/p>\n<\/div>","20":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: USA<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022Price range: $35-45K<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022Lease or Buy: Buy<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022New or used: New<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022Type of vehicle: Crossover<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022Must haves: (AWD, Navigation, Turbo or V6, Leather, sporty feel)<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc): Auto<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022Intended use: Daily Driver<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: Volvo XC40, Mazda cx5<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022Is this your 1st vehicle: no<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022Do you need a Warranty: no<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle: (fluids, alternator, battery, brake pads etc)  Yes<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022Can you do Major work on your own vehicle: (engine and transmission, timing belt\/chains, body work, suspension etc )  no<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022Additional Notes:  Looking for a sporty midsize crossover.

I need a vehicle that will please my husband. He panics and worries and thinks any car I want to choose will instantly roll 30 times and burst into fiery goodness the moment the key fob is touched.  If it were up to me, I would probably be driving a 2009 Merc around, or any number of early 90&#39;s sports cars.  What I need is something that is not too old so that hubby will not complain any more daily than current, and something that makes me feel good to drive, something I enjoy driving.  Personally, I am a fan of heart throb early 90&#39;s sports cars.  I&#39;ve never actually owned an Audi, but I have owned and maintained VW&#39;s and BMW&#39;s for many years, I understand the territory.   I am leaning towards Audi because of Quattro, as it seems there is at least a marginal difference in how it plays in the snow compared to the other options.  Subaru is an option, even tho I don&#39;t love the boxer sound.  They should be equally at home in the snow.  We are about to move to Syracuse, and I want rid of my current 2015 Altima which I both don&#39;t really enjoy, and have my doubts about driving in the northern winters. <\/p>\n\n<p>I hate SUV&#39;s, but it seems everyone loves them because they might need to haul something one day and want to drive a bus around just in case.  I drove an MR2 around for 6 years and even moved house during that time - never needed to haul anything.  But, to appease the hubby, I have included some selections of SUV which I think would make decently cheap winter drivers.  Is there something that might please both I haven&#39;t thought of?  I&#39;m open to exploring and considering American offerings, but I would rather stay away from Viscous coupled drive types.  I drove an Equinox for years in the winter, of which I went through two viscous couplers because I tend to drive a lot in the snow, and I&#39;m not really known for having a light touch in winter.  POWER! <\/p>\n\n<p>What is out there that might be cool-interesting-fun, AWD, and under $15,000 - The reasons hubby is upset are the usual: Japanese cars are more reliable, parts are cheaper, his mom drove an audi and it broke all the time, American cars are unreliable but he&#39;s never driven one...; yet he drives a Land Rover HSE sport that I have to work on or have maintained because I am the car enthusiast and he could care less!
