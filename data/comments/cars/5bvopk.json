Highly prefer automatic, I can&#39;t drive manual, but I might be willing to learn if I fall in love with one. Not must haves, but some major pluses would be heated seats, possibility for roof racks(for kayaks), leather seats. I don&#39;t need a sports car, but I would like something that feels at least a little bit sporty and fun.<\/p>\n\n<p>Intended use: Daily Driver<\/p>\n\n<p>Vehicles I&#39;ve already considered:<\/p>\n\n<p>1) Hyundai Veloster turbo - Probably my top choice right now. when my car was being repaired I had one of these as a rental(not the turbo but the base model) and I loved it. Maybe I&#39;m easily impressed since I drive a 2004 civic but I love the way it looks and feels. Most hatchbacks and coupes around my price range don&#39;t impress me visually speaking but I really love the way the veloster looks. My only concerns are the fact it gets pretty mediocre reviews.<\/p>\n\n<p>2) Volkswagen Golf\/Golf GTI - This car doesn&#39;t impress me visually but it seems to be rated a lot higher than the Veloster in general. The GTI is a little out of my budget range, but I might be willing to pay more if I feel I&#39;m getting my money&#39;s worth. It&#39;s grown a lot on me recently, I&#39;m just worried a bit about the price of the GTI.<\/p>\n\n<p>3) Honda Civic coupe EX-T - I may be slightly biased toward hondas, as literally every car in my family is currently a honda, but I feel like this would definitely be a safe option, and they&#39;ve always been very reliable for us. I like the way it looks, and it seems to have most of the things I want. I would consider the hatchback, but I don&#39;t like the way it looks very much.<\/p>\n\n<p>4) Kia Forte Hatchback(SX trim) - It doesn&#39;t look bad, it has good features, pretty good performance, and it&#39;s a good price for everything I want.<\/p>\n\n<p>5) Mini Cooper S - I&#39;m still not sure whether I actually like the mini or not, but I&#39;m keeping my mind open.<\/p>\n\n<p>6) Mazda Mazda3 hatchback(touring 2.5) - Not really sold on the Mazda yet, even though it seems like everyone else loves them.<\/p>\n\n<p>7) Ford Focus ST\/Fiesta ST - I want to consider these cars, but they both are manual only, and I can&#39;t drive manual at the moment. I&#39;d be willing to learn, but it&#39;s time consuming and I don&#39;t have much free time with work etc. Plus I can&#39;t test drive it until then.<\/p>\n\n<p>Is this your 1st vehicle: first car I&#39;m buying for myself.
