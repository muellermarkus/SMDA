with my car situation. For background I\u2019ve owned a BRZ and an e46 M3 (both of which I tracked extensively and loved) before buying and keeping my current e92 M3 for daily use and track use around once a month. Yes I have owned other cars like the GT350 and a 991.1 GT3 which I absolutely loved and is one of my favorite cars ever but i have had to unfortunately  I had to get rid of them as I moved to a big city and it became financially unfeasible to keep and track more than one car. <\/p>\n\n<p>I love my M3, but I need to decide whether to dump around $15k in upgrades in brakes\/cooling\/suspension refresh (currently has 75k miles and I\u2019ve already done rod bearings and valve cover gaskets) or go for a new car that hopefully won\u2019t need too many modifications to hold up to extensive track use. My budget is around $65k but I can stretch to $75k if need be. I\u2019m currently looking at 991.1 C2Ss, 981 and 718 Cayman GTSs as well as the GT350 and C7 grand sport. However after my experience in the e92 and the GT350 compared to my previous cars, I would prefer a lighter car and hopefully something slightly practical as this will be my daily that I track once (or twice) a month. <\/p>\n\n<p>Let me know what you guys think and I look forward to your recommendations!

It is fully paid off, but honestly I am leery of its reputation for transmission and drive train issues. I ended up with it as my vehicle after my 2015 civic (that I had paid off \ud83d\ude1e) got totaled when I got tboned at an intersection. This car was the best I could find with my payout.<\/p>\n\n<p>I figure if I can get 13-14k or so for the vehicle I could get into a more reliable vehicle at a reasonable cost. But while I can afford it, I just have a hard time making that jump. I tend to just hate having any amount of debt and a new 10k loan just feels like a drag.<\/p>\n\n<p>I know it is hard to help people make value judgments, but I feel like I haven&#39;t gotten anywhere thinking about it. The Altima has been fine, but given I got it right before Covid, I have only put like 6000 miles on it, and like 800 of that was one trip.<\/p>\n\n<p>What trim levels would be equivalent?

Acura TL, Lexus IS200, driven all three cars and they\u2019re decent cars. Nissan Altima\u2019s are decent daily\u2019s too. Or Mazda 3s. You can get a car that\u2019s marked down a lot more if it has a salvage title. But you have to see where the car had a the crash if it crashed in the engine don\u2019t buy. But if it\u2019s just the frame than that\u2019s fine. You could get a newer car that\u2019s salvage for a lot lower price. A lot of people advise against getting a salvage car title but if it\u2019s just frame work than your fine. The dealership fixed it already. But that\u2019s up to you if you mind.<\/p>\n<\/div>"},"comment_toplevel":{"0":1,"1":1,"2":1,"3":1,"4":1,"5":1,"6":1,"7":1,"8":1,"9":1,"10":1,"11":1,"12":1,"13":1,"14":1,"15":1,"16":1,"17":1,"18":1,"19":1,"20":1,"21":1,"22":1,"23":1,"24":1,"25":1,"26":1,"27":1,"28":1,"29":1,"30":1,"31":1,"32":1,"33":1,"34":1,"35":1,"36":1,"37":1,"38":1,"39":1,"40":1,"41":1,"42":1,"43":1,"44":1,"45":1,"46":1,"47":1,"48":1,"49":1,"50":1,"51":1,"52":1,"53":1,"54":1,"55":1,"56":1,"57":1,"58":1,"59":1,"60":1,"61":1,"62":1,"63":1,"64":1,"65":1,"66":1,"67":1,"68":1,"69":1,"70":1,"71":1,"72":1,"73":1,"74":1,"75":1,"76":1,"77":1,"78":1,"79":1,"80":1,"81":1,"82":1,"83":1,"84":1,"85":1,"86":1,"87":1,"88":1,"89":1,"90":1,"91":1,"92":1,"93":1,"94":1,"95":1,"96":1,"97":1,"98":1,"99":1,"100":1,"101":1,"102":1,"103":1,"104":1,"105":1,"106":1,"107":1,"108":1,"109":1,"110":1,"111":1,"112":1,"113":1,"114":1,"115":1,"116":1,"117":1,"118":1,"119":1,"120":1,"121":1},"comment_distinguished":{"0":null,"1":null,"2":null,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null,"7":null,"8":null,"9":null,"10":null,"11":null,"12":null,"13":null,"14":null,"15":null,"16":null,"17":null,"18":null,"19":null,"20":null,"21":null,"22":null,"23":null,"24":null,"25":null,"26":null,"27":null,"28":null,"29":null,"30":null,"31":null,"32":null,"33":null,"34":null,"35":null,"36":null,"37":null,"38":null,"39":null,"40":null,"41":null,"42":null,"43":null,"44":null,"45":null,"46":null,"47":null,"48":null,"49":null,"50":null,"51":null,"52":null,"53":null,"54":null,"55":null,"56":null,"57":null,"58":null,"59":null,"60":null,"61":null,"62":null,"63":null,"64":null,"65":null,"66":null,"67":null,"68":null,"69":null,"70":null,"71":null,"72":null,"73":null,"74":null,"75":null,"76":null,"77":null,"78":null,"79":null,"80":null,"81":null,"82":null,"83":null,"84":null,"85":null,"86":null,"87":null,"88":null,"89":null,"90":null,"91":null,"92":null,"93":null,"94":null,"95":null,"96":null,"97":null,"98":null,"99":null,"100":null,"101":null,"102":null,"103":null,"104":null,"105":null,"106":null,"107":null,"108":null,"109":null,"110":null,"111":null,"112":null,"113":null,"114":null,"115":null,"116":null,"117":null,"118":null,"119":null,"120":null,"121":null},"comment_edited":{"0":1629743697.0,"1":1629860986.0,"2":1629746251.0,"3":false,"4":false,"5":false,"6":false,"7":1630077334.0,"8":false,"9":false,"10":false,"11":1629778616.0,"12":1629761415.0,"13":false,"14":false,"15":false,"16":1629911161.0,"17":false,"18":false,"19":false,"20":false,"21":false,"22":false,"23":false,"24":false,"25":false,"26":false,"27":false,"28":false,"29":false,"30":false,"31":1630168886.0,"32":false,"33":false,"34":false,"35":false,"36":false,"37":false,"38":false,"39":false,"40":false,"41":false,"42":false,"43":false,"44":false,"45":1629740783.0,"46":false,"47":false,"48":false,"49":false,"50":false,"51":false,"52":false,"53":false,"54":false,"55":false,"56":false,"57":false,"58":false,"59":false,"60":false,"61":1629828898.0,"62":false,"63":false,"64":false,"65":false,"66":false,"67":false,"68":false,"69":false,"70":false,"71":false,"72":false,"73":1629877911.0,"74":false,"75":false,"76":1629893803.0,"77":false,"78":false,"79":false,"80":false,"81":false,"82":false,"83":false,"84":false,"85":false,"86":false,"87":false,"88":false,"89":false,"90":false,"91":false,"92":false,"93":false,"94":false,"95":false,"96":1630195077.0,"97":false,"98":false,"99":false,"100":false,"101":false,"102":false,"103":false,"104":false,"105":false,"106":false,"107":1630296033.0,"108":false,"109":false,"110":1630317794.0,"111":false,"112":false,"113":false,"114":false,"115":false,"116":false,"117":false,"118":false,"119":false,"120":false,"121":false},"comment_is_submitter":{"0":false,"1":false,"2":false,"3":false,"4":false,"5":false,"6":false,"7":false,"8":false,"9":false,"10":false,"11":false,"12":false,"13":false,"14":false,"15":false,"16":false,"17":false,"18":false,"19":false,"20":false,"21":false,"22":false,"23":false,"24":false,"25":false,"26":false,"27":false,"28":false,"29":false,"30":false,"31":false,"32":false,"33":false,"34":false,"35":false,"36":false,"37":false,"38":false,"39":false,"40":false,"41":false,"42":false,"43":false,"44":false,"45":false,"46":false,"47":false,"48":false,"49":false,"50":false,"51":false,"52":false,"53":false,"54":false,"55":false,"56":false,"57":false,"58":false,"59":false,"60":false,"61":false,"62":false,"63":false,"64":false,"65":false,"66":false,"67":false,"68":false,"69":false,"70":false,"71":false,"72":false,"73":false,"74":false,"75":false,"76":false,"77":false,"78":false,"79":false,"80":false,"81":false,"82":false,"83":false,"84":false,"85":false,"86":false,"87":false,"88":false,"89":false,"90":false,"91":false,"92":false,"93":false,"94":false,"95":false,"96":false,"97":false,"98":false,"99":false,"100":false,"101":false,"102":false,"103":false,"104":false,"105":false,"106":false,"107":false,"108":false,"109":false,"110":false,"111":false,"112":false,"113":false,"114":false,"115":false,"116":false,"117":false,"118":false,"119":false,"
