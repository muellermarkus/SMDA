For some reason auto manufacturers make awful websites for actually shopping by feature. The Honda Fit had looked promising, but navigating up and down Honda&#39;s website between the different models and configuration per model to find out if they automatically parallel park sucks.

I&#39;m figuring I can for sure sell her Pathfinder for $2,000, if not $2,500. She drives a lot as her family lives almost 3 hours a way and she visits them a couple of times a month.

She currently has a 2002 Nissan Pathfinder with 230k miles on it. Seems there&#39;s something new that&#39;s wrong with it every other week. The ride is so unsmooth, I feel like I need to vomit any time she or I are driving it around the Ozarks. Which, I never get with my 2008 Pontaic G5. I&#39;m figuring I can for sure sell her Pathfinder for $2,000, if not $2,500. She drives a lot as her family lives almost 3 hours a way and she visits them a couple of times a month. And, her work requires she does a decent amount of driving in a day (30-60 miles a day). Don&#39;t think her Pathfinder is gonna be able to hold that down at 230k miles. <\/p>\n\n<p>My dad has a 2006 Chevy HHR with 250k miles he was going to sell us for cheap at $2100. Drives fantastic, new tires. But, I took it to a mechanic and 30 error codes popped up in the diagnostics. 36 before they changed out the spark plugs. They aren&#39;t very confident about HHRs making it much past 250k miles.<\/p>\n\n<p>So, that&#39;s the situation I&#39;m in.<\/p>\n<\/div>","78":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: California<\/p>\n\n<p>Price range: flexible. under $30k would be nice<\/p>\n\n<p>Lease or Buy: Buy<\/p>\n\n<p>New or used: New<\/p>\n\n<p>Type of vehicle: smaller car, sporty (replacing a Mini Cooper)<\/p>\n\n<p>Must haves: Fuel efficient, sporty acceleration, minimal length (city parking)<\/p>\n\n<p>Desired transmission: auto<\/p>\n\n<p>Intended use: Daily Driver<\/p>\n\n<p>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: Mini Cooper, Audi TT (too expensive)<\/p>\n\n<p>Is this your 1st vehicle: no<\/p>\n\n<p>Do you need a Warranty: good question<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle: no<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle: hahaha no<\/p>\n\n<p>Additional Notes: My &#39;09 mini Cooper died suddenly and I haven&#39;t been watching the market for a replacement.
