I start medical school in 2019. Budget wise, I know the ecoboost is more appealing. Better gas mileage (even if its not that significant doing city\/hw driving), insurance is lower (even if its only 10$ difference per month), in addition to the final OTD price (20k). Considering I have only driven civics and hondas, the EBM feels very powerful and very fun. The artificial exhaust doesn&#39;t even bother me. I love the look, and I am not a die hard mustang enthusiast. However, I am concerned about the reliability of the EBM&#39;s engine. Most of the used models I have seen are 2015+ and can vary from 34k-64k miles. Overall, I am concerned about how the previous owners may have redlined and abused the car, not keeping up with maintenance, etc. I do not intend to really do any modifications to the car. I am leaning towards the GT only if I can find a good deal (24k OTD). The price difference between a turbo 4cyl and v8 of 4k is insignificant over the grand scheme of things, and I plan to pay all at once. Plus I am also trying to consider the long term trade in\/ resale value of the v8 vs EBM.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Also, I am very interested in a convertible. I am aware that performance will suffer, but I really want to be able to drop the top down and cruise. With that said, can anyone talk to me about the cons of a convertible? <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<\/div>","60":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[gel\u00f6scht]<\/p>\n<\/div>","61":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil<\/p>\n\n<p>\u00b7 Price range: 50k<\/p>\n\n<p>\u00b7 Lease or Buy: Buy<\/p>\n\n<p>\u00b7 New or used: Used or New<\/p>\n\n<p>\u00b7 Type of vehicle: SUV<\/p>\n\n<p>\u00b7 Must haves: Fuel efficient, Reliability, Not too expensive to own<\/p>\n\n<p>\u00b7 Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc): Auto<\/p>\n\n<p>\u00b7 Intended use: Daily Driver<\/p>\n\n<p>\u00b7 Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: We&#39;ve taken a look at a couple, we liked the new Chevy Equinox, VW Tiguan, but we&#39;re also interested on the Merc GLC250, BMW X1\/X3, Audi Q3<\/p>\n\n<p>\u00b7 Is this your 1st vehicle: No<\/p>\n\n<p>\u00b7 Do you need a Warranty: No but one would be nice<\/p>\n\n<p>\u00b7 Additional Notes: My dad&#39;s looking for a new car to replace his Fiat Toro, he drives over 25.000 miles a year so we need something reliable and that won&#39;t give us any surprises, he does some light off-roading as he goes to many construction sites, we want something nice for him to take clients and all the yada yada yada.<\/p>\n<\/div>","62":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: northern NJ<\/p>\n\n<p>Price range: $20k max<\/p>\n\n<p>Lease or buy: Buy<\/p>\n\n<p>New or used: Either, preferably late-model used or CPO<\/p>\n\n<p>Type of vehicle: 4 door hatchback\/wagon.

My last car, a Scion xA, was purchased new in 2005 and didn&#39;t have breakdowns, failures, or issues at all other than a brake problem at one point that was a $400 fix.<\/p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t drive much - just to a train station for my 5-day commute, which is around 3 miles away on suburban streets, errands, to\/from orchestra practices at least once a week with my wife (like 20-40 minutes on the Parkway given traffic), and I think I&#39;d like to get something a little more fuel efficient if I can get it while keeping AWD.  I&#39;d also really like a car that&#39;s nice to be in.  The xA was good for what it was; a utilitarian personal transport that was exceptionally reliable and a gas sipper.  I gave some thought to a CPO or used 3-series until I realized how much it&#39;d cost.<\/p>\n\n<p>I would want to pay cash for this, so $20k is absolute and total maximum.<\/p>\n\n<p>I normally don&#39;t consider American cars but if it&#39;s really a better buy with a better reliability track record than my Legacy, I would give them fair consideration.
