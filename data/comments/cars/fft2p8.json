Cons: I will get in trouble with this car, I already own one car with a V8, boomer status symbol<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.miata.net\/gallery\/images\/09red.jpg\">NC Mazda Miata<\/a> - Pros: About $5k cheaper, convertible, slower so I can drive it like I stole it without breaking the law, smaller. Cons: Slower, less V8 noises, almost comically small for someone my size, &quot;boy racer&quot;<\/p>\n\n<p>For the Corvette I&#39;d likely do mods such as exhaust, intake, cam, and a tune.  <em>Maybe<\/em> forced induction.  It will be dangerously fast.  For the Miata I&#39;ll almost definitely either do a 2.5L swap or turbo, which will be fast, but still extremely usable.<\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m test driving a Corvette today so I can get some seat time in each car.  It seems like a no-brainer to go for the Corvette on paper, but for some reason I&#39;m leaning toward the Miata.

I don&#39;t take many longer trips, Drive to ATL a few times a year and Florida once a year.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<\/div>","12":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Location:<\/strong> Utah, USA  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Price range: $25k-$35k<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Lease or Buy: Either<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>New or used: New<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Type of vehicle:<\/strong> Car\/Sports car\/performance car  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Must haves: 250+HP, manual transmission<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc): Manual<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Intended use:<\/strong> Daily driver  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: Veloster N Performance Pack, Honda Civic Type R, Genesis G70 Sport<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Is this your 1st vehicle: No<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you need a Warranty: Yes<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> Yes  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> Yes  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Additional Notes: I have a secondary weekend car for when I get the drive to wrench on something, so I&#39;m looking for a daily driver that in stock form will still be sporty\/performance oriented enough I&#39;ll leave it alone... haha<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<\/div>","13":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Location:<\/strong> Illinoi  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Price range:<\/strong> $20-22k USD (after taxes and everything)  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Lease or Buy:<\/strong> Buy  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>New or used:<\/strong> Either  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Type of vehicle:<\/strong> Coupe, Hatchback, Sedan (least likely)  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Must haves:<\/strong> Navigation, Leather seats  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc):<\/strong>  Auto, have friends and fam who can teach me manual, but am not too keen on the idea because I am sometimes in traffic.  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Intended use:<\/strong> Daily Driver, may make minor upgrades after having is stock for a year.  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered:<\/strong> Eco-boost mustang, GTI, ST (It&#39;s stick), all are difficult to find for 20-22k.   <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Is this your 1st vehicle:<\/strong> yes  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you need a Warranty:<\/strong> No  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> Yes  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> certain things yes  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Additional Notes:<\/strong>  Am in my early 20&#39;s and am looking for a nice car that I can take care of, will be fun to drive with some power, and that will get a few people&#39;s attention.

My financial situation is somewhat tight, as I&#39;m financing all of my college expenses except for miscellaneous grocery shopping and such. My family is willing to help with car payments, but I want to minimize the burden for them as much as possible.<\/p>\n\n<p>We&#39;re also paying off our house still, so that&#39;s another loan my family is paying off. Personally, I&#39;d like to get a car that I&#39;ll use till it dies, aka I want to keep it, and I&#39;m debating between Toyota, Honda, and Hyundai (more on that in a bit). I&#39;d mostly like to buy used, as that&#39;s how you&#39;d get the best deal if you play your cards right, and correct me if I&#39;m wrong but from what I understand, as long as a respected mechanic inspects it and says it&#39;s good, I&#39;m good to go right?<\/p>\n\n<p>Another person suggested I lease instead, since the costs could potentially be lower per month, but obviously it&#39;ll be more expensive in the long run. I&#39;m not really feeling it, as even though maintenance is taken care of, it still costs a ton, there&#39;s a fat down payment, and I don&#39;t even own the car in the end.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now, Toyotas and Hondas are known for their crazy reliability, so they are obvious picks for cars. On the other hand, Hyundais seem to have a really good value for money compared to its Japanese competitors, and I get a lot for less of a premium than said Japanese competitors. I&#39;m also aware of their somewhat notorious reputation for reliability in the past, but I&#39;m hearing that they&#39;ve really turned it around recently.<\/p>\n<\/div>","42":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Location:<\/strong> Michigan  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Price range:<\/strong> My current maximum is $8000-9000, but I can save more overtime.  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Lease or Buy:<\/strong>   Buy  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>New or used:<\/strong>   Used  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Type of vehicle:<\/strong> Wagon,  Sedan,  Hatchback, Sports  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Must haves:<\/strong> Fun color, relatively cheap to repair, hopefully 4 seats but ok if only 2, good headlights and good in the snow :)  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc):<\/strong> Either Manual or Automatic  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Intended use:<\/strong>  Daily Driver\/ Small Project  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered:<\/strong> VW GTI, Honda CRX\/CRZ, Early 80&#39;s Mustang  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Is this your 1st vehicle:<\/strong> No, I&#39;ve been driving a 2005 Outback for a while  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you need a Warranty:<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> Yes  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> I&#39;m willing to learn.  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Additional Notes:<\/strong> I really like the body style of cars from the mid 80s but I do not know much about upkeep of older cars.

Seems silly to pay a premium for the BMW when all I really want is 6 cylinders and a manual, though right now it seems the most logical.<\/p>\n\n<p>Curious what y&#39;all would do.<\/p>\n\n<p>Thanks!<\/p>\n<\/div>","50":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: Buffalo, NY<\/p>\n\n<p>Price range: $20-30k, flexible within reason<\/p>\n\n<p>Lease or Buy: Buy<\/p>\n\n<p>New or used: New<\/p>\n\n<p>Type of vehicle: Compact or Hatchback<\/p>\n\n<p>Must haves: Wheels<\/p>\n\n<p>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc): Automatic<\/p>\n\n<p>Intended use: Daily<\/p>\n\n<p>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: Elantra, Forte GT, Jetta, GLI, GTI, Focus<\/p>\n\n<p>Is this your 1st vehicle: no<\/p>\n\n<p>Do you need a Warranty: not necessarily<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle: maintenance, sure<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle: nope!<\/p>\n\n<p>Additional Notes: Just found out my old 2010 Jetta is a goner (accident \ud83d\ude2d)<\/p>\n\n<p>Thinking of buying a new compact or hatchback, something sporty perhaps.

Growing up my father had a beautiful 1960s emerald green Ford Mustang Fastback.  I was too young to legally drive it but I got to run it up and down our street a few times when I was about 10, steering and shifting while my father worked the pedals.  He loved that car and drove it even in the winter, regardless of conditions, washing and waxing it at least once a week year round.  It was unfortunately, lost in a fire when lightning struck our house and it spread to our attached garage and the roof fell on it.  We even lost his pictures of the car.  A few years back we lost my father as well and I had mostly forgotten about the car until a family reunion this past summer where my mother brought up stories of how he loved that thing more than he loved her.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Amusing family anecdotes aside, I&#39;ve always kinda been jealous of my brothers and sisters since they mostly got to drive it and I didn&#39;t, I&#39;m the youngest by 5 years and the baby of the family.  So, I am on a quest to get a car like the one he had.  Now I know that it&#39;ll never be exactly the same, cars in as good a condition as his was are significantly outside my budget for a secondary car.  However I am wondering if this dream is obtainable at all in my budget and if so, if someone could help push me in the right direction.  I&#39;m not looking for &quot;100% authentic original parts&quot; or anything like that, and I mostly just care that it looks the part.  What makes it hard is none of us can even agree on what year it was.  We don&#39;t have any of the paperwork and everyone seems to remember a different date somewhere between 1965 and 1969.  If someone could help push me in the right direction I would appreciate it.<\/p>\n<\/div>","58":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: Colorado foothills<\/p>\n\n<p>Price range: $35k max <\/p>\n\n<p>Preferably New (I have access to Employee pricing on new Jeeps)<\/p>\n\n<p>Type of Vehicle: SUV<\/p>\n\n<p>Must Haves: 4x4, Trailer Hitch for towing a whitewater raft\/trailer, sufficient clearance to tackle 4x4 and forest service roads, enough cargo space for weekend camping.<\/p>\n\n<p>Desired Transmission: Auto<\/p>\n\n<p>Intended Use: daily driver and weekend warrior in the mountains.
