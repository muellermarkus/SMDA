Is this accurate, and is it due to the FWD drive train?

I can&#39;t trust the covers. Must also be petrol powered. Will consider petrol-electric if it meets other requirements.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Must haves:<\/strong> Need to fit Wales in the boot. 4WD is needed for bad weather \/ dirt tracks. The engine must be moddable, though I&#39;ll be going to a specialist garage. Cameras and carplay\/android auto are unnecessary because I&#39;ll be adding them myself, but steering wheel controls (or at least the ability to retrofit them) is a must. Fuel efficiency needs to be at least somewhat OK, I know it may change with upgrades but a reasonable base efficiency is needed.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Desired transmission:<\/strong> I&#39;m learning manual, so the car has to be manual too.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Intended use:<\/strong> Motorway driving, driving very quickly at airfields and racetracks (safely ofc), occasional Aldi shopping trip.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered:<\/strong> Audi A4 Avant (B7).

Probably a small to mid sized hatchback, easier to park the better as the current Primera is becoming a struggle. 5 door mandatory.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Must haves:<\/strong> Weather sucks here, so 4WD would be nice but the current car does fine with RWD so it&#39;s not a strict requirement. Ability to retrofit stuff like a headunit is a must, will be adding one so we have cameras. Good fuel efficiency for cost saving, ULEZ compliance. Unlikely to mess with the powertrain. Either petrol, petrol-electric or pure electric. If pure electric, large a battery as possible and there must be some ability to have batteries replaced. Low tax would be nice.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Desired transmission:<\/strong> Automatic, mum has arthritis and it&#39;s hard enough to use the manual so this can&#39;t be manual.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Intended use:<\/strong> Basically school run and small to medium shopping.

And im looking to buy my first long term car (5-15 years) ive owned an old beater escape before this and then when it broke down upgraded to an 09 honda accord, and really the coupe is what set my eyes on sports\/coupe cars it was weird at first but grew to love it (even knowing the accord isnt a sports car, just the low ride) <\/p>\n\n<p>So my budget is about 20k give or take, im flexible as i plan on putting down around 10k and financing the rest. I can either buy a relatively new 86\/brz, or buy a body and LS swap it for roughly 12-15k in total including a new transmition. My main points of discussion being i want a car thats gonna drive fast, drift, and be a daily (i know its a lot to ask for so its stupid of me) i would take the car out to tracks on occasion and have track tires for it obv. Whats stopping me from building it is im currently in school and dont really have the time to build it so i dont know where or how to start if i did want to do the build in a shop, as i recently moved to texas. <\/p>\n\n<p>Some other things to know, i have looked at 350 and 370z&#39;s, but the 370 are a bit out of my price range for the mileage im looking for. And the 350&#39;s are a bit old for my taste granted not opposed to it. I thought about turbo charging the 86\/frs but im worried about the engine giving out on me and being down nearly 20k or more. I want to stick to japanese cars and that is why i have not brought up stangs, camaros or challengers. If it comes down to it an 86 will do fine, the new model has a 2.4L engine which is really nice but im not willing to fork over the 9k it will cost brand new just for it to instantly lose value. Once again i want a coupe. Also im gonna cosmetically mod it and i dont just want it to be a riced out snail.<\/p>\n\n<p>Reason i want an 86\/frs is i like the look, real wheel drive, heard they are fun to drive and also very easily moddable cars with a good community around it.<\/p>\n\n<p>Any advice on what to buy, or how to go about building it? Should i just mod the 86\/FRS\/BRZ? Should i do something completely different (car that im missing out on)? 350z? Wait to buy a better car for what im asking for?<\/p>\n<\/div>","49":"<div class=\"md\"><p>For some background I&#39;m looking for an <strong>easy<\/strong> project car to work on, the Galant has about 180,000 miles on it and has been sitting for awhile, its hard to say the condition but last time it was started it sounded pretty good, would it be a better idea to try to get this thing in running condition (change brakes and fluids) or sell it and put it towards another project car?

I\u2019m not really interested in having constant repairs, so probably no Volkswagen\/ Audi\/ Mercedes\/ BMW (even though the luxury brands are out of my price range new anyways). <\/p>\n\n<p>The charger I test drove felt like crap, and I\u2019m kind of at a loss as to where else to go from here, any help is greatly appreciated as from what I can tell the WRX seems to be the only vehicle of its type at the moment.<\/p>\n<\/div>","83":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: Kansas City Missouri<\/p>\n\n<p>Price range: less than 36k<\/p>\n\n<p>Lease or Buy: prefer buy<\/p>\n\n<p>New or used: prefer new<\/p>\n\n<p>Type of vehicle: flexible, prefer sedan or crossover <\/p>\n\n<p>Must haves: adaptive cruise, lane keep, prefer 4wd or hybrid<\/p>\n\n<p>Desired transmission: auto<\/p>\n\n<p>Intended use: daily driver<\/p>\n\n<p>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: Ford Maverick, Toyota Camry and Corolla <\/p>\n\n<p>Is this your 1st vehicle: no<\/p>\n\n<p>Do you need a Warranty: would prefer it <\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle: yes but would prefer not to<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle: no<\/p>\n\n<p>Additional Notes: would prefer either something a little more sporty or off road capable.
