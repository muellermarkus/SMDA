Probably looking to only spend around 40-45k. <\/p>\n\n<p>Another question the retail price I see car manufacturers websites, I pay below that right?

Now I am budget and space limited to one car and while I can&#39;t drive an M3 onto a jobsite, I want something that can be mildly enjoyable on some of the great roads I get to drive.  I&#39;ve thought a tuned 2.0t Escape or edge could be fun.  The CX5 isn&#39;t bad to drive and the Forester comes with a manual.  <\/p>\n<\/div>","11":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: Cheshire, UK<\/p>\n\n<p>Price range: Below 5K<\/p>\n\n<p>New or used: Used<\/p>\n\n<p>Type of vehicle: Sports<\/p>\n\n<p>Must haves: RWD or AWD<\/p>\n\n<p>Intended use: Daily<\/p>\n\n<p>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: Mazda MX5<\/p>\n\n<p>Is this your 1st vehicle: Yes<\/p>\n\n<p>Does the vehicle need to have a warranty: No<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle: Yes<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle: No<\/p>\n\n<p>Additional Notes:Looked around online, everybody says MX5 but are there any other options out there that are as good for the price?<\/p>\n<\/div>","12":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[gel\u00f6scht]<\/p>\n<\/div>","13":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: Los Angeles\/Orange County, USA\nPrice range: 1k-7k\nNew or used:used\nType of vehicle: Anything\nMust haves: Air conditioning, Trunk space (enough to fit surfboard), good gas mileage\nIntended use: Mainly on the weekends to drive home (about 60 miles)\nVehicles you&#39;ve already considered: Used 2002 BMW 325 Ci\nIs this your 1st vehicle: Yes\nDoes the vehicle need to have a warranty: No\nCan you do Minor work on your own vehicle: If there is a Youtube video for it I can figure it out.\nCan you do Major work on your own vehicle: Probably not<\/p>\n<\/div>","14":"<div class=\"md\"><ul>\n<li><p>Location: Georgia<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Price Range: up to $5,000<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>New or Used: Used<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Type of Vehicle: sporty fun type <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Must Haves: Manual gears, RWD, Cheap <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Intended Use: every day driving and potentially taking it to tracks and drift events <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Vehicles You&#39;ve already considered: BMW E36, E46, 240sx, Miata, 240z,260z,280z, rx8, 350z, <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Is this your 1st vehicle: yes<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Does the vehicle need to have a warranty: No<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle: Of course <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle: No<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>","15":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[gel\u00f6scht]<\/p>\n<\/div>","16":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: Hollywood, Florida <\/p>\n\n<p>Price range: ~$10k-11k<\/p>\n\n<p>New or Used: Used <\/p>\n\n<p>Type of Vehicle: Coupe, Sports car<\/p>\n\n<p>Must haves: V8<\/p>\n\n<p>Intended use: Project car (possibly track car)<\/p>\n\n<p>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: \n-2009 Mustang GT<\/p>\n\n<p>Is this your first vehicle: No<\/p>\n\n<p>Does the vehicle need to have a warranty:  No<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle: Yes<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle: No (I can, but I don&#39;t plan on doing the major work by myself for this car)<\/p>\n<\/div>","17":"<div class=\"md\"><p>A friend needs a car for her job, thought I&#39;d post here:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Location<\/strong>: London, UK<\/li>\n<li><strong>Price Range<\/strong>: $1900-2000<\/li>\n<li><strong>New or Used<\/strong>: Used<\/li>\n<li><strong>Type of Vehicle<\/strong>: Wants a small manual car<\/li>\n<li><strong>Must haves<\/strong>: Nothing major really but fuel efficiency would be good.

I&#39;m getting married in May 2017. I have a 6-figure job but little savings ATM because I&#39;m trying to keep wedding expenses from sitting on my credit cards too long.<\/p>\n\n<p>My Nissan Altima 2-door Coupe was re-ended and totaled on Sunday. I&#39;m interested in purchasing a new car but I&#39;m torn between two options. The first option is to get a base-line model but get the best trim of that line (Versa is my first choice). It would have great gas mileage and allow me to save money for my wedding. The other option is to get a bigger, safer car with bad gas mileage (4Runner is my first choice). <\/p>\n\n<p>I need help with my logic behind purchasing either vehicle. My goal is to keep my payments below $500 a month. My idea was to eventually give this car to my fiancee because her 4Runner is a 2007 and will need to be traded in 3-5 years. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>So, here&#39;s my logic for option 1:<\/strong> <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Positive)<\/strong> It&#39;s a cheap car that gets great gas mileage. Its not flashy and gets me from point A to point B. It has a hatchback and fold-down seats when I need storage. If I get the Versa, I can have leather installed and walk out spending ~19k. If I stretch the term of the loan, my monthly payments would be ~$200 which means plenty of disposable income for the wedding\/honeymoon. If I wanted to pay it off quickly, I could pay it off in 3 years (~$500 a month). It&#39;s smaller and will make parking in the city easier. I&#39;ve been quoted between $19-21k with leather seats for the Versa. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Negative)<\/strong> Its not as safe as a bigger car. My fiancee would not want this car as her daily driver down the road. I have to pay extra (at least in the Versa) for third party leather seats. Not all the luxuries of a larger, high-end car. May have trouble commuting in the snow.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Logic for option 2:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Positive)<\/strong> Its safe. My fiancee will love to have this car when its time for her to get rid of her car. All the luxuries of a higher-end car. It will be our new vacation car (we go camping 4-5 times a year and take beach trips 2 times a year). Plenty of space for all of our gear. It holds its value very well (if its a 4Runner) and I could always trade down to something cheaper if needed. No trouble commuting in the snow. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Negative)<\/strong> The only way I can afford this car is to have a long lease term. I do get a bonus at the end of each year (~20-50% of my salary) and I could pay it down with that or just have a long lease term (I can keep it under $500 a month with my credit union). Potentially have less money on hand for the wedding\/honeymoon. Terrible gas mileage. I&#39;ve been quoted between $39-42k for the 4Runner.<\/p>\n\n<p>So, there are my options. I&#39;m really torn which direction I should go in. If anyone had time to get this far into the comment, I would love your opinion.

I can do most work that doesnt require a lift or specific machines<\/li>\n<li><strong>Additional Notes<\/strong>:I currently own a &#39;13 Focus ST with some mods.\nLooking to either continue modding the ST (Big turbo and aux fuel to get around 400-450hp) or looking to purchase something that has quicker acceleration.When it comes to power top end isnt something I really care about (even though I would be adding a larger turbo to a FWD car).\nI much prefer quick acceleration and handling. Looks are also somewhat
