Lease is coming up in Feb. I love my car as it&#39;s my current DD, but also my occasional track car. This is probably the only car I&#39;ve actually loved and cared about. But with my daughter being 9 months and growing, we just don&#39;t have room in it. When my wife and daughter ride in it, my wife has to ride in the backseat because she can&#39;t sit in the passenger side because the car seat is large and the seat  needs to be moved forward. The hatchback room can barely fit her stroller in there, and if we take a backpack it has to go under it. But you wouldn&#39;t be able to load anything else really in there. My wife drives a 17 Ford Escape which we use most of the time, but I don&#39;t always want to drive her car. I would like to occasionally drive my own car to relieve the burden off of hers. I&#39;m just so lost on what to do in regards to what my next car could be. Do I still want to have fun and go to the track? Yes. But I&#39;m 32 now and would like something a little sophisticated to take my wife out on the town.

Mainly plan on using it a few times a week for grocery runs in residential Brooklyn, or just driving around within NYC. Maybe a short road trip or two a year.<\/p>\n\n<p>I guess I&#39;m looking for a good, reliable first car that will last me a long time and is cost-efficient. I&#39;m looking for any and all suggestions because I don&#39;t really have an idea where to start.

I have a &#39;99 c5 with 70k miles, and a &#39;15 Charger SE AWD with 14k miles. I&#39;ve been tossing around the idea of selling both or trading both in towards something still fun (waaaay different from a vette, i know), but with the practicality of the charger (yeah yeah yeah RWD with snow tires is better than AWD on all seasons, don&#39;t care). Not looking to make a move any time soon, but just wanted to see what reddit thought. Ideally, in the next year or three the plan would to be to move into something AWD, fast, sounds great, and has good modding potential once warranty is up (because let&#39;s face it, no matter how much I say i&#39;m leaving it stock, it&#39;s not happening).<\/p>\n<\/div>","95":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>This is probably the last high-discretionary income based car I get to buy before I have kids<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>I was ready to recommend a Mazda CX-5 until I read this.  If you haven&#39;t test driven one, do it. I think you&#39;ll like the sporty handling, the utility, and the price tag won&#39;t offend you.
