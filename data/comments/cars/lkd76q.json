Driver door can&#39;t open all the way due to the fender. The A-arm is bent backwards and the car can&#39;t turn left. New Michelin tires on it, ~2months old. Bought the car 2 years ago for $7k, now has ~103k miles on it with minor issues with cruise control not responding, rear wiper broken, sticky horn, and possible(?) belt issue and coolant leak.<br\/>\nConsidering the repairs could cost anywhere from $2000-4000 not including bodywork which I&#39;d try to do myself, I&#39;m wondering if it&#39;s worth repairing or if I should get a new car. The car itself has very little value nowadays.<br\/>\nI&#39;m looking at a used 2013 Ford C-Max SEL Hybrid that&#39;s in great condition, no accident history, one lease owner and one purchased owner previously.

I am spending more to maintain it than I would be on a car payment... so I think it&#39;s time.

I have been looking for a new car for a while, as the wife and I are expecting, but this last week weather-wise has expedited that need. I&#39;m currently driving a 2006 Pontiac G6 GTP, and I&#39;m starting to notice it&#39;s age and limitations. I&#39;m just too attached to this car. It was the first car I bought, I&#39;ve almost put 100k miles on it and it&#39;s got all the features I would ever need. But it&#39;s a coupe, it&#39;s terrible for winter and it&#39;s 16 years old now. I&#39;ve found a relatively nice 2013 Audi Q5 that matches my Pontiac in just about every feature and then some, for a price that is square in my price range. Please help with any insights on the Q5 you may have.

Just want to see some ideas and recommendations, thanks.<\/p>\n<\/div>","85":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;m an American living in Europe (Hungary). I&#39;ve been kicking around the idea of buying a relatively inexpensive third car in the hopes of importing it to the US and selling for a profit next time I visit. <\/p>\n\n<p>Ideally, I&#39;m looking for something 1996 or older and under $5k. I&#39;d like to be able to flip whatever it is for, say, around $10k in the US. I&#39;m willing to spend a bit more to make a bit more money, and, for the right car, I might be willing to hold on to it for a year or two before importing.<\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m looking for thoughts and suggestions on models to look at. Here are a few that I&#39;ve found while browsing local classified that look promising--<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Subaru Impreza GT - European version of the 1st generation (GF) WRX with an EJ20T. Pretty rare, I think, but there happens to be one for sale near me.<\/li>\n<li>Subaru BRAT - Also pretty rare, but, again, there&#39;s one for sale near me right now at a price I consider okay.<\/li>\n<li>Honda Civic VTi - European version of the 6th generation (EJ\/EK\/EM) Civic Si. Unlike the US version of the Civic Si from this generation, these were available in coupe, sedan, hatchback, and wagon (Aerodeck) versions with either the same B16A2 as the US market version or with a B18C4 making 170 HP. The B18 versions also get an LSD. There are a bunch of these, and they&#39;re relatively cheap, but depending on the example might require waiting a year or two to import. <\/li>\n<li>Lada Niva - Plentiful and cheap, but not always in the best condition. Luckily, parts are relatively cheap, and local labor isn&#39;t expensive either. I&#39;m not sure about the US market for these.<\/li>\n<li>Suzuki Samurai (SJ) - Not quite as plentiful and cheap as the Niva, but not particularly rare. There&#39;s a really cute SJ pick-up for sale near me. Looking at past auctions on Bring A Trailer shows pretty good prices even for ones that have some problems.<\/li>\n<li>Toyota HiLux 4x4 - These occasionally pop up at reasonable prices. They&#39;re usually diesels with lots of km on them. Not sure what the US market looks like.<\/li>\n<li>Mitsubishi Delica \/ L300 4x4 - Also pop up occasionally at reasonable prices. Usually diesel. <\/li>\n<li>Toyota Land Cruiser LJ70 - They&#39;re a bit over my $5k budget. Usually 2.4L turbodiesel with a lot of km. Seems like they would sell well in the US.<\/li>\n<li>Random Kei vans (Subaru Sambar 4x4, Daihatsu HiJet) - Do people want these in the US?<\/li>\n<li>Misc. other Hondas - I see CRXs at not-absurd prices, VTEC Preludes and Accord Type-R at not-bad prices, and occasionally weird stuff like a cute little AA-chassis Honda Jazz.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>So, those are some of the car models I&#39;ve got in my bookmarks. <\/p>\n\n<p>You might notice the Japanese theme here. I&#39;m working on the assumption that people would be more willing to buy Japanese classics due to reliability, relative availability of parts, and popularity\/reputation of the brands. Also, unlike the JDM versions of the cars, the European versions have the steering wheel on the correct side.<\/p>\n\n<p>I have checked out some of the European brands, but I have some doubt about people having any demand for English, French, or Italian cars that they won&#39;t be able to get parts for. If I&#39;m wrong about that, and there are some specific models to look at, let me know.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are a bunch of German cars on the market. I&#39;m not really interested in German cars, but if I can make some money, I could be into them. From just browsing around, it seems like the ones available here are often worse than what was sold in the US with less powerful engines and more basic interiors. The prices of E30s here seem just as stupid as E30 prices in the US. With that said, if there&#39;s something I&#39;ve missed that would sell well in the US, let me know.<\/p>\n<\/div>","86":"<div class=\"md\"><p><strong>Location:<\/strong> Florida, USA<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Price range:<\/strong> The $16,000-20,000 ballpark is my comfort zone; I&#39;m not expecting to do so, but if I&#39;m in a pinch, I&#39;d have zero issues coming up to $21k-23 territory.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Lease or Buy:<\/strong> Buy<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>New or used:<\/strong> Used, CPO<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Type of vehicle:<\/strong> Hatchback <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Must haves:<\/strong> A Japanese badge, <em>bulletproof reliability<\/em>, and a hatchback\/liftgate.
