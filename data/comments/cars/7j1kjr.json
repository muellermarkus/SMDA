In 2012 through September, I used to drive 8 miles to work (I&#39;m a psych nurse working overnights at a hospital), so on the worst weather\/snowy\/icy nights, I&#39;d catch a ride with a co-worker with a meaty Ford Explorer.  In September however, I took a new position at a different hospital, which is 53 miles away. So now I am driving over 100 miles each day to work along the I-81 corridor.<\/p>\n\n<p>So yeah, I-81 between Binghamton and Syracuse is pretty brutal: Lake effect snow, blowing, just terribad... and I have been trying to do it in a sports car (without its snow tires, not that they help much anyways!)<\/p>\n\n<p>I decided to start looking into getting a 2nd car for winter travel, and I wanted an SUV (4WD or AWD), probably a smaller SUV with an automatic transmission because I also have a 16-year old son who needs to learn how to drive, and I don&#39;t want to even attempt to teach him on my Genesis, especially in this weather.<\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve been browsing Craigslist, Facebook, other online car forums, etc. and I guess I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that if I buy from a dealer, I may get a more guaranteed vehicle, but at a higher price than say if I buy one from a private party. Of course at $5000, I&#39;m going to be in older vehicles with more mileage, and so I&#39;m not sure what matters the most - if it&#39;s less miles or what...  <\/p>\n\n<p>I have zero skills in car maintenance, and I am not known to take very good care of my cars as it is. I work night shift and sleep during the day, so reliability is a big part for my transportation, and I don&#39;t want to spend $5000 only to get a PoS that I have to get to the shop during the day when I am supposed to be sleeping in order to go back to work at 11pm that night.<\/p>\n\n<p>Soooo - I have turned to my Reddit friends for advice, suggestions, recommendations, including if you are in my general area +\/- 3 hours or so from Binghamton, NY and you happen to have a car that suits my needs, let me know specifically :)<\/p>\n\n<p>Location: Upstate New York<\/p>\n\n<p>Price range: Max around $5000<\/p>\n\n<p>Lease or Buy: Buy<\/p>\n\n<p>New or used: Used<\/p>\n\n<p>Type of vehicle: SUV<\/p>\n\n<p>Must haves: AWD or 4WD<\/p>\n\n<p>Desired transmission: Sadly, this one has to be an automatic<\/p>\n\n<p>Intended use: Highway Driving about 500 miles a week in the winter weather of upstate New York<\/p>\n\n<p>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: I like the looks of the Nissan Rogue and Murano, Jeep Liberty &amp; Patriot, Ford Edge, Toyota RAV4, Honda CR-V, etc. I&#39;m not a big fan of Escapes, Trailblazers, Dodge\/Pontiac and no thank you to any white colored vehicle (Yes, I am getting nit-picky now, I know - SORRY :)<\/p>\n\n<p>Is this your 1st vehicle: Nope<\/p>\n\n<p>Do you need a Warranty: Doubt I&#39;d get offered one at this price<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle: Sadly, No.<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle: OMG, I wish.<\/p>\n\n<p>THANK YOU Reddit Friends!!<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Karma<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>","5":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Hey all!

Then I realized the Wrangler 2-Door is about as short as a Renegade, and is clearly a more proven car for northeast winters, and older models can be had for around the same price as a renegade.

I read on the interwebs that these are both amongst the most popular used cars, is one preferable to the other for reselling?<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I am still recovering from the brief time that I owned a 1990 BMW e30.

I want the complete opposite of that, i.e. something as low-maintenance as possible.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Hmmmm what else....I have no kids and no pets, no need for cargo space. I am currently driving a rental that my insurance company will cover for 10 days starting tomorrow, and I work 60 hours a week 7 days a week so I have very limited time to look around.
