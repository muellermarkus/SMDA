I really think the new Qashqai fits all we need, but my wife is more &quot;classy&quot; and likes the new Audi Q2 (which I think is quite expensive and not as big as I&#39;d like).

All it heeds to do is be able to drive to my house. If it ends up being a Civic\/Corolla or something basic, I&#39;d probably just sell it for scrap before winter (I live in Ottawa, Canada, and I&#39;d be buying it springtime next year). If I were able to get something cool like a Foxbody (pretty rare here for less then $4k) or a Ranger, I&#39;d think about trying to fix it up and get it saftied, and keeping it as a second car. I want to focus on Japanese or American cars, and I&#39;d like something with a great aftermarket. Is my best bet gonna be a shitty old civic, or are there some good interesting options availible?

So, I&#39;m torn between buying a small but fun car like a Miata MX5 (which doesn&#39;t cost much in terms of maintenance, insurance, taxes and so on) and a bigger car like an E46 3-series, which is a bit too expensive in terms of what I just listed. I&#39;m looking for something in the middle maybe, because the Miata would be perfect if it was just a little bigger. A 4-seater (even 5) hatchback would be the perfect compromise, if I have to carry around my guitar and amplifier to some gig. I also really like sedans. It shouldn&#39;t be too powerful either, because I&#39;m 19 and the insurance costs for me are crazy (insurance companies think that every young driver is a dangerous entity on the road).

Our take home is ~$7000k a month (after insurance, 401k, etc.). We don&#39;t have kids and aren&#39;t planning on it. I&#39;ll be 33 in December. Both jobs are steady. Both investing for retirement (though it isn&#39;t maxed out). I&#39;m in grad school, but my company is paying for most of it. We&#39;ve paid off her master degree and have no loan debt on debt for her. Our only debt, is basically our mortgage of $1400 and her car payment is $419. It&#39;s a 2014 with low miles that will be paid off in the next 2 years (plan is to use most of the bonus money to pay off a large chunk of it ahead of schedule). We set aside money for entertainment and food.<\/p>\n\n<p>We have roughly $2,400 at the end of the month after paying for bills, investments, etc. (that&#39;s with $1500 allocated for food\/fun for the month).<\/p>\n\n<p>I bought a 2010 Accord LX brand new and paid it off in 2 years. It will be traded in towards the purchase. Maybe I&#39;m overvaluing it, but I&#39;m hoping the dealer will give me at least 9-10k for it as it&#39;s still in great condition. Being a car guy and suffering through my daily drive 4-door sedan, I want to get back into something fun.<\/p>\n\n<p>Chevy is offering 0% APR for 72 months on the 2016&#39;s. I wasn&#39;t planning on buying right now and know that the deal will probably happen next fall as well (when they try to get rid of the 16&#39;s). I haven&#39;t saved any to put towards a larger down payment, so the Accord trade in will be it. My reasoning for considering now, is that the 0% apr for the extended length of financing will off-set the lack of a larger down payment (am I right to think this way?).<\/p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s say the Corvette I want is $60k. If I finance $50k (which I know sounds stupid, but it&#39;s at 0% apr) then the payment + tax comes out to $750 a month. <\/p>\n\n<p>That leaves us with $1650 to put into general savings, toward larger retirement contributions, or for extra expenses that come up.<\/p>\n\n<p>Main question:\nThoughts? <strong>Is spending 11% of our monthly after tax income toward a car payment stupid to my fellow car enthusiasts?<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/div>","12":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I currently have a Japanese FWD hybrid and a German AWD sedan.

I&#39;m a (wannabe) enthusiast in that I plan on owning project cars in the future, but I don&#39;t have the money\/time at this stage in my life.\nI want a car that feels &quot;fast&quot; and sounds good when I put my foot down. I also want this car to be a &quot;keeper&quot; - as in, I don&#39;t want to get bored of it before I&#39;m out of college (keep for 3 years). Something that I could break traction and drift around rainy parking lots once in awhile would be cool :)<\/p>\n\n<p>I also don&#39;t want this to be a &quot;racecar&quot; - I&#39;d prefer it had a relatively nice interior finish, and luxury features like leather heated seats would be a HUGE plus - I want non enthusiasts (girls, mostly) to think &quot;nice car&quot; when they get in, or at the very least not see it as a &quot;shitty old car&quot;<\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve been looking at older Japanese luxury models like the G35 coupe, which I feel is the perfect car for me.

That way I can spend money on performance (suspension) parts as things wear out and not feel too guilty about wasting money. Easy\/&quot;cheap&quot; engine swaps (junkyard LS\/T56 builds) and good stock engines for FI fall into this category. This would be nice, but not at all necessary. <\/p>\n\n<p>For reference, my &quot;ideal&quot; car is a V8 E46 - fast, practical, and relatively understated.<\/p>\n\n<p>I realize I have tons of requirements, but maybe there&#39;s cars out there I haven&#39;t considered.
