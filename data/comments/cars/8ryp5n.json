Looks like Chevy doesn&#39;t want my business much.<\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve returned several times to sit in the Mustang, as well as check out other stuff on the lot like a Focus ST and Fiesta ST. Between those two, I&#39;d lean focus, but the pedal placement is a bit weird. Reason I lean focus is because the fiesta&#39;s wheels and tires are TINY in diameter.<\/p>\n\n<p>And, despite being about the same lengthwise and height wise for passengers(not cargo, though), it&#39;s skinnier. Focus has more width, and a tad more legnth to the cargo area behind the rear seats, and bigger wheels\/tires, so I like all of that better. Oh, and more power with a bigger engine, of course. ;)<\/p>\n<\/div>","12":"<div class=\"md\"><ul>\n<li>Location: Texas<\/li>\n<li>Price range: &lt;20 - 26k<\/li>\n<li>Lease or Buy: Buy<\/li>\n<li>New or used: Used<\/li>\n<li>Type of vehicle: Sedan<\/li>\n<li>Must haves: RWD, 300+hp, Must handle.<\/li>\n<li>Desired transmission: Do I have much of a choice in 2018? - I just hope the paddles are responsive.<\/li>\n<li>Intended use: Daily Driver and Family Car<\/li>\n<li>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: 14+ Q50 S, 14+ CTS Premium, 15+ Genesis 5.0<\/li>\n<li>Is this your 1st vehicle: lol, no<\/li>\n<li>Do you need a Warranty: omg, yes<\/li>\n<li>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle: Yes but, time is money<\/li>\n<li>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle: Nope.<\/li>\n<li>Additional Notes: I need some help <a href=\"\/r\/cars\">\/r\/cars<\/a>, I&#39;m racking my brain.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Backstory: I took in my Nephew.....2 seaters are simply no longer an option for a daily now.<\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve never owned anything but low to the ground, RWD coupes and I haven&#39;t had a car with a backseat in about 7 years.<\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m leaning really hard towards a 14-15 Q50 S because I&#39;m a Nissan Guy at heart and I know from owning a 370Z that the VQ37 is just solid and won&#39;t give me any problems.......I miss worry free ownership after almost 3 years with a tuned N54<\/p>\n\n<p>I was thinking about a CTS because I love, love, love the front end on it - interior isn&#39;t bad, Camaro platform, is SUPPOSED to handle well but the 15 Premium I drove felt like a tank.......not nearly as nimble as the Q50 S was<\/p>\n\n<p>Was thinking about a 14+ Genesis 5.0 but have yet to drive one, the 3.8 was quicker and more graceful than the CTS however.<\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not looking to get back into anything German or European.<\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m trying to keep it in the 24-26k range (saving for a house)<\/p>\n\n<p>tl;dr Help a car guy find a reliable and fun sedan that can carve a canyon or mountain road and have enough grunt to pass slow idiots.<\/p>\n<\/div>","13":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: Boston area<\/p>\n\n<p>Price range: $12k-15$k - can go higher if needed<\/p>\n\n<p>Lease or Buy: buy<\/p>\n\n<p>New or used: new or just about (3 years or less)<\/p>\n\n<p>Type of vehicle: sedan \/ hatchback<\/p>\n\n<p>Must haves: reliable, good value, low cost to own, fuel efficient<\/p>\n\n<p>Desired transmission auto only<\/p>\n\n<p>Intended use: daily driver<\/p>\n\n<p>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: toyota corolla<\/p>\n\n<p>Is this your 1st vehicle: no<\/p>\n\n<p>Do you need a Warranty: not necesarily, but would prefer a very reliable vehicle, low cost to own<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle: NO<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle: NO<\/p>\n\n<p>Additional Notes:<\/p>\n\n<p>Looking to replace my mother&#39;s 2015 corolla, not sure if I should just get her the same, or find something better.\nGoal for the car is to be daily driver, but even there limited.
