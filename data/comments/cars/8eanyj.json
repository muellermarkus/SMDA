I&#39;d like to finally get something a little more luxurious and get rid of the soccer mom stigma. I&#39;m all over the place with models right now. I like the Range Rover look but a new one is out of my price range.

I&#39;ve looked at the 2018 Kia Niro PHEV, which I liked other than the fact that it has no crash ratings (that I could find). The price is also a little restrictive, but better with the tax credit anyway. I&#39;d like your opinions on the Kia especially. \nI&#39;ve looked at the Tesla Model X but that&#39;s way out of my price range. 30 000 is basically my limit. The Toyota RAV4 also seemed good but my friends were instantly sceptical of how &#39;manly&#39; a car the RAV4 was. \nI&#39;ve looked at two smaller cars, the Prius and Honda Accord. They&#39;re too small for my liking, but if you can really sell me on them I&#39;ll take another look at it. The size preference is a consequence of my comfort (I&#39;m a large guy -- 180 cm, broad shoulders and chest, long legs) also I feel far safer in a larger car. If it&#39;s worth taking a second look at either of these or any smaller cars let me know what you have in mind and why.<\/p>\n\n<p>I just wanted to add that range anxiety isn&#39;t huge for me.
