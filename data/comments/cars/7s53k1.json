The mileage is great and we can take our 2 dogs around. It can also transport 10ft boards inside when the occasional DIY project calls. The problem is that over the past couple of months we have been having mice problems with the Prius. Only once did a mouse get into the cabin, but we have been back to the dealer twice because of mice getting into the air system. <a href=\"https:\/\/priuschat.com\/threads\/toyota-claims-not-aware-of-mouse-problem.113690\/\">It turns out that the problem is widespread and unacknowledged by Toyota.<\/a> Multiple entry points and soy-based wiring seem to be the big issues in regards to this.<\/p>\n\n<p>I think we are just looking for a reliable car with decent mileage, with no known mouse issues, and not prone to being easily stolen.<\/p>\n\n<p>Any input would be appreciated!

Something practical, fun, and with the capability to get more into this as a hobby with track days in the future. So far I have been leaning pretty heavily towards a GTI, just wanted some input from people more knowledge than I am! Thanks!<\/p>\n<\/div>","100":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: Balkans (countries are small, so I can travel if I need to, to get the car and import it)<\/p>\n\n<p>Price Range: 7,000 - 9,000 Euros<\/p>\n\n<p>Lease or Buy: Buy, leases are really crummy here, unless you are buying something really expensive<\/p>\n\n<p>New or used: Used, can&#39;t really buy new with that amount of cash<\/p>\n\n<p>Type of vehicle: Hatchback or sedan, if possible sportier<\/p>\n\n<p>Must haves: Air conditioning, can&#39;t be too low (roads are shite), 4\/5 doors if it&#39;s a hatch, other than that I don&#39;t care about bells and whistles<\/p>\n\n<p>Desired Transmission: Manual<\/p>\n\n<p>Intended use: Daily driver for a young dude without a family, but I won&#39;t be using it all the time because I live in a small town and don&#39;t need it to go to work, so it doesn&#39;t have to be all too cheap to run<\/p>\n\n<p>Vehicles I&#39;ve considered: I am a big fan of Japanese cars from the 90s, but there are none here, I was thinking maybe a 1 series BMW, Golf, Seat Leon, 3 series maybe... Also a project car is fine too, but the market is full of junk, and most older cars haven&#39;t been taken care of properly.<\/p>\n\n<p>Is this your first car: YUP!!!<\/p>\n\n<p>Do you need a Warranty: Nope<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle: I know a good bit about cars, and have helped my Grandad do simple repairs when I was a kid, also I can always learn and read up, so a YES to some repairs<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle: No. Wouldn&#39;t know how and even if I did, I have no tools.<\/p>\n\n<p>Additional Notes: The market here is very slim, I might have to import a car from Germany or somewhere, many cars that are on sale used here are imports from other more wealthier countries and the dealers usually import the cheap ones to make a big profit. There are a lot of low spec cars, so it&#39;s hard to find something specific like a Golf GTI (not that I can afford one), and if you do it&#39;s very overpriced. So suggestions from other European countries are fine. <\/p>\n<\/div>","101":"<div class=\"md\"><p><strong>Location:<\/strong> Tampa, FL<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Price range:<\/strong> $8,000-$12,000<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Lease or Buy:<\/strong> Buy<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>New or used:<\/strong> Used<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Type of vehicle:<\/strong> Hopefully a coupe, or a sedan if it looks nice haha.
