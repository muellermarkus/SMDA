It has a little under 100k miles (150k km, I&#39;m in Europe). <\/p>\n\n<p>My girlfriend (30F) and I (29M) have been contemplating buying an &#39;affordable&#39; convertible for some spirited weekend driving since we drive boring company cars during the week.

Long gears.<\/p>\n\n<p>Mustang GT:\nSounds amazing, handles well, not as good compared to the above 2. Probably too much power for me. MT82 has some issues, long gears. Also concerned about the drivability of this v8 beast in Ontario winters.<\/p>\n\n<p>STI:\nThe idea of having the confidence to drive at any weather is amazing, and the car sounds pretty good too. Holds value really well. Reliability concerns, but if I buy it new\/lease and keep it stock, shouldn&#39;t be a problem. Won&#39;t really teach me how to drive though. The most mechanical car out of the bunch here I think?<\/p>\n\n<p>Focus RS:\nSame as STI really, but no warranty.

All will be V6, Auto, 4WD, and 2004-2006. <\/p>\n\n<p>Our goals:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>automatic<\/li>\n<li>2006 or earlier <\/li>\n<li>under 180 inches long<\/li>\n<li>AWD<\/li>\n<li>6 cyl<\/li>\n<li>not an SUV<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s my current thoughts:<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>TT<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>pros: <\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>sporty<\/li>\n<li>my partner loves the styling<\/li>\n<li>smallest, so presumably easiest to drive in the city<\/li>\n<li>would contrast well vs the legacy<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>cons: <\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>useless back seats<\/li>\n<li>not much cargo room<\/li>\n<li>may not actually handle much better than the A3<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p><strong>A3<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>pros: <\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>reasonably practical re seats, space<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>cons: <\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>styling feels compromised, like a knockoff A4<\/li>\n<li>i don&#39;t really have a strong opinion on this car, it feels kind of forgettable<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p><strong>A4 Avant<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>pros:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>real quattro (tm) AWD<\/li>\n<li>classic styling and true wagon form<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>cons:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>apparently the V6 has a scary situation re the timing chain<\/li>\n<li>no DSG<\/li>\n<li>likely going to become redundant vs the legacy<\/li>\n<li>rare<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>I&#39;m buying this car through a broker special order so I don&#39;t think I&#39;d be able to test drive these cars to compare.

We have a pretty anxious doggo, so we would like to be able to put a dog crate in the backseat\/trunk area to help with car rides. Definitely want a new car, mostly for a warranty, But also just like the idea of a brand new car. Our first car we bought together was a new 2015 Mazda3, and we have absolutely loved it, it it my daily driver still. When we moved to NH we needed a second car, so we bought a used 2013 Subaru impreza. It&#39;s been a good car, but when I think about our overall experiences with both, buying a car brand new just wins every time. This new car will be my wife&#39;s daily driver(the 80 miles round trip for work). We easily split weekend driving between the two, but if its any extended mileage we drive the Mazda because it gets better gas mileage.<\/p>\n\n<p>Thanks!<\/p>\n<\/div>","43":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: Dallas Texas<\/p>\n\n<p>Price range: Up to 25k<\/p>\n\n<p>Lease or Buy: Buy, putting 10k down<\/p>\n\n<p>New or used: EITHER<\/p>\n\n<p>Type of vehicle: Prefer sportish, fuel efficient but open to all recommendations <\/p>\n\n<p>Must haves: N\/A<\/p>\n\n<p>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc): Any<\/p>\n\n<p>Intended use: DAILY DRIVER<\/p>\n\n<p>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: All the civics, accords, Kia K5, Camry, Mazda3, Audi A4<\/p>\n\n<p>Is this your 1st vehicle: Yes<\/p>\n\n<p>Do you need a Warranty: Yes<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle: (fluids, alternator, battery, brake pads etc): Yes<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle: (engine and transmission, timing belt\/chains, body work, suspension etc ): NO<\/p>\n\n<p>Additional Notes: I need help with realizing what\u2019s a good deal for certain cars and what\u2019s not, I really like the 2021 civic sport hatchback but been told for 25k you can get a better car.<\/p>\n<\/div>","44":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Hi everyone, I&#39;m thinking of purchasing a new vehicle for my mother while taking her old 2009 Camry.

Like, you want to buy Vehicle A but for some reason it doesn&#39;t work out, how do you decide to go to Vehicle B.  Also, how close is A to B?

I&#39;m having a tough time deciding which route to take though. <\/p>\n\n<p>I was able to test drive the cars I&#39;m considering and I liked all of them honestly. The Tundra was kind of on a whim since I really don&#39;t need something that size at this point in my life... it was tempting though because I absolutely love the interior. It&#39;s so spacious and fun to drive though! It was at 110,000 miles and going for $27.5k.<\/p>\n\n<p>The Tacoma I saw was a 2020 with 20,000 miles. 4cyl 2.4l I think SR5? It did have 4WD. It was listed at $24,000. Since I really don&#39;t need something that can tow a ton of weight and mostly just want to be able to take it on some basic off road trails I think the 4cyl would suit me just fine from what I&#39;ve been reading.<\/p>\n\n<p>I like the idea of the SUVS for having the trunk space to build a platform for a bed in the back. I especially like the idea of having the panoramic sun roof in the Grand Cherokee Overland. I love 4Runners and just finished a 2 week trip through California in my friends. It seems like it would cost me a bit more than the Grand Cherokee however... although maybe not in the long run. Just hard to find any 4Runners listed under 30k. The Grand Cherokee Overland I saw was $30k and at 51,000 miles. Not sure if that&#39;s a bit high or not.<\/p>\n\n<p>My only other consideration so far has been to save some money and go with a Subaru Outback. The AWD will still probably suit my needs as I don&#39;t really need to do anything crazy, but it would be nice to have the option for some more intense trails so I&#39;ve still been leaning towards 4x4.<\/p>\n\n<p>The trucks were the only 2 I tested and saw in person so far that seemed like the prices were decent, but I guess that&#39;s why I&#39;m here.

Very good fuel economy. <\/p>\n\n<p>+Heard the adaptive cruise control (ACC) is pretty good.

I am not comparing Honda ACC to Tesla &quot;full-self-driving.&quot;<\/p>\n\n<p>---Commonly hear complaints of the road noise, and the stock speakers (and premium stock speakers) are considered bad. My personal experience with older models aligns with this sentiment. I am unclear how I would go about upgrading the audio. I think Honda uses noise canceling mics to help with it&#39;s already terrible road noise. They might need to be disable for an aftermarket install? I am not sure if I would feel comfortable doing the install myself.

those.<\/p>\n<\/div>"},"comment_toplevel":{"0":1,"1":1,"2":1,"3":1,"4":1,"5":1,"6":1,"7":1,"8":1,"9":1,"10":1,"11":1,"12":1,"13":1,"14":1,"15":1,"16":1,"17":1,"18":1,"19":1,"20":1,"21":1,"22":1,"23":1,"24":1,"25":1,"26":1,"27":1,"28":1,"29":1,"30":1,"31":1,"32":1,"33":1,"34":1,"35":1,"36":1,"37":1,"38":1,"39":1,"40":1,"41":1,"42":1,"43":1,"44":1,"45":1,"46":1,"47":1,"48":1,"49":1,"50":1,"51":1,"52":1,"53":1,"54":1,"55":1,"56":1,"57":1,"58":1,"59":1,"60":1,"61":1,"62":1,"63":1,"64":1,"65":1,"66":1,"67":1,"68":1,"69":1,"70":1,"71":1,"72":1,"73":1,"74":1,"75":1,"76":1,"77":1,"78":1,"79":1,"80":1,"81":1,"82":1,"83":1,"84":1,"85":1,"86":1,"87":1,"88":1,"89":1,"90":1,"91":1,"92":1,"93":1,"94":1,"95":1,"96":1,"97":1,"98":1,"99":1},"comment_distinguished":{"0":null,"1":null,"2":null,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null,"7":null,"8":null,"9":null,"10":null,"11":null,"12":null,"13":null,"14":null,"15":null,"16":null,"17":null,"18":null,"19":null,"20":null,"21":null,"22":null,"23":null,"24":null,"25":null,"26":null,"27":null,"28":null,"29":null,"30":null,"31":null,"32":null,"33":null,"34":null,"35":null,"36":null,"37":null,"38":null,"39":null,"40":null,"41":null,"42":null,"43":null,"44":null,"45":null,"46":null,"47":null,"48":null,"49":null,"50":null,"51":null,"52":null,"53":null,"54":null,"55":null,"56":null,"57":null,"58":null,"59":null,"60":null,"61":null,"62":null,"63":null,"64":null,"65":null,"66":null,"67":null,"68":null,"69":null,"70":null,"71":null,"72":null,"73":null,"74":null,"75":null,"76":null,"77":null,"78":null,"79":null,"80":null,"81":null,"82":null,"83":null,"84":null,"85":null,"86":null,"87":null,"88":null,"89":null,"90":null,"91":null,"92":null,"93":null,"94":null,"95":null,"96":null,"97":null,"98":null,"99":null},"comment_edited":{"0":false,"1":false,"2":false,"3":false,"4":false,"5":false,"6":false,"7":1630341243.0,"8":1630351638.0,"9":false,"10":false,"11":false,"12":false,"13":false,"14":false,"15":false,"16":false,"17":false,"18":1630781224.0,"19":1630789910.0,"20":false,"21":false,"22":false,"23":false,"24":false,"25":false,"26":false,"27":false,"28":false,"29":false,"30":false,"31":false,"32":false,"33":false,"34":false,"35":false,"36":1630400393.0,"37":false,"38":false,"39":false,"40":false,"41":1630385822.0,"42":false,"43":false,"44":false,"45":false,"46":false,"47":false,"48":false,"49":false,"50":false,"51":false,"52":false,"53":false,"54":false,"55":false,"56":false,"57":false,"58":false,"59":false,"60":false,"61":false,"62":false,"63":false,"64":false,"65":false,"66":false,"67":false,"68":false,"69":false,"70":1630637279.0,"71":false,"72":false,"73":false,"74":false,"75":false,"76":false,"77":false,"78":false,"79":false,"80":false,"81":false,"82":false,"83":1630922268.0,"84":false,"85":false,"86":false,"87":1630899613.0,"88":false,"89":false,"90":false,"91":false,"92":1630709739.0,"93":false,"94":false,"95":false,"96":false,"97":false,"98":false,"99":false},"comment_is_submitter":{"0":false,"1":false,"2":false,"3":false,"4":false,"5":false,"6":false,"7":false,"8":false,"9":false,"10":false,"11":false,"12":false,"13":false,"14":false,"15":false,"16":false,"17":false,"18":false,"19":false,"20":false,"21":false,"22":false,"23":false,"24":false,"25":false,"26":false,"27":false,"28":false,"29":false,"30":false,"31":false,"32":false,"33":false,"34":false,"35":false,"36":false,"37":false,"38":false,"39":false,"40":false,"41":false,"42":false,"43":false,"44":false,"45":false,"46":false,"47":false,"48":false,"49":false,"50":false,"51":false,"52":false,"53":false,"54":false,"55":false,"56":false,"57":false,"58":false,"59":false,"60":false,"61":false,"62":false,"63":false,"64":false,"65":false,"66":false,"67":false,"68":false,"69":false,"70":false,"71":false,"72":false,"73":false,"74":false,"75":false,"76":false,"77":false,"78":false,"79":false,"80":false,"81":false,"82":false,"83":false,"84":false,"85":false,"86":false,"87":false,"88":false,"89":false,"90":false,"91":false,"92":false,"93":false,"94":false,"95":false,"96":false,"97":false,"98":false,"99":false},"comment_score":{"0":5,"1":6,"2":5,"3":5,"4":4,"5":7,"6":3,"7":3,"8":3,"9":2,"10":2,"11":2,"12":2,"13":2,"14":2,"15":2,"16":2,"17":2,"18":2,"19":2,"20":2,"21":2,"22":2,"23":1,"24":1,"25":1,"26":1,"27":1,"28":1,"29":1,"30":-1,"31":1,"32":1,"33":1,"34":1,"35":1,"36":1,"37":1,"38":1,"39":1,"40":1,"41":1,"42":1,"43":1,"44":1,"45":1,"46":1,"47":1,"48":1,"49":1,"50":1,"51":1,"52":1,"53":1,"54":1,"55":1,"56":1,"57":1,"58":1,"59":1,"60":1,"61":1,"62":1,"63":1,"64":1,"65":1,"66":1,"67":1,"68":1,"69":1,"70":1,"71":1,"72":1,"73":1,"74":1,"75":1,"76":1,"77":1,"78":1,"79":1,"80":1,"81":1,"82":1,"83":1,"84":1,"85":1,"86":1,"87":1,"88":1,"89":1,"90":-2,"91":-1,"92":-1,"93":0,"94":0,"95":0,"96":0,"97":0,"98":1,"99":1},"comment_stickied":{"0":false,"1":false,"2":false,"3":false,"4":false,"5":false,"6":false,"7":false,"8":false,"9":false,"10":false,"11":false,"12":false,"13":false,"14":false,"15":false,"16":false,"17":false,"18":false,"19":false,"20":false,"21
