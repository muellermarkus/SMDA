I just test drove an automatic and manual BRZ (which the dealer told me I was pretty good at manual for spending an hour of my life total in one before), but definitely need to still learn and get comfortable with stick. I do not have anyone I can learn on their cars, which means my natural conclusion is to buy a car and force myself to learn. I enjoyed the BRZ, but it was a bit too small for me.
