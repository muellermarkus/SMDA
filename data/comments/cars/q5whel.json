They both are about the same price with the off-road being just about 500 dollars more. So my first issue is the mileage, being the same price basically, is it bad to go with the sport that is 24k miles more for the same price just for the color, tech, safety features it has? It also has some rust under it that the dealer sent me a picture of ill post it here. Im new to trucks so this may just be normal wear\/rust but i wasnt sure. Also the off-road has some smoker smell that the dealer said they can remove but no burns, holes, discoloration anywhere inside.<\/p>\n\n<p>All this being said what do you all think? I know tacomas are know to be great trucks which is why i picked them. To summarize im just looking to answer:<\/p>\n\n<p>-is 24k miles that much different between the two in regards to 85k vs 109k? <\/p>\n\n<p>-Sport vs Off-road resale value later in the future (speaking of which i dont do much off-roading. Just forest service roads, snow, etc. occasionally).<\/p>\n\n<p>-Tech pkg vs basic off-road <\/p>\n\n<p>-The rust on the 2017 Sport an issue or normal wear?<\/p>\n\n<p>any information would be great, thanks! <a href=\"https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/03T13ZM\">https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/03T13ZM<\/a><\/p>\n<\/div>","1":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: USA.

Looking around and researching car brands and models for my needs and tastes the next few months and to track market prices. <\/p>\n\n<p>Location: Central NC with 4 seasons, humid summers and light-moderate snow\/ice conditions. Flat to low hills terrain. I don\u2019t anticipate many long rides up north or west.<\/p>\n\n<p>Budget: &lt;$10K Cash or &lt;$20K finance with 20% down. Lower the better but flexible on budget overall. Want to find a \u201cgreat deal\u201d to market and willing to travel up to 2hrs away from location. <\/p>\n\n<p>Buy Used from Authorized, Secondary retailers or Private if cash (Craigslist)<\/p>\n\n<p>Type: Mid-Sedan (open to Small) Car<\/p>\n\n<p>Must Haves: Good safety ratings, backup camera, good MPG, reliability, lower costs to own.<\/p>\n\n<p>Transmission: Auto, V4 but can be persuaded to V6 if trim meets must-have criteria. Open to AWD if economical on gas. <\/p>\n\n<p>Use: Primary Daily Driver, Personal and Business (up to ~250mi one way highway trips 3-5 times a month). Solo driver most of the time, occasional adult passengers in rear seats for short city trips.  Want to own for next 5-8 years.<\/p>\n\n<p>Considering: 2014+ Accord, 2010+ Prius, 2010+ Camry, 2014+ Mazda6, 2015+ Sonata, 2015+ Legacy (but heard reliability is spotty for Subaru).  <\/p>\n\n<p>If you do recommend an Accord or Camry above all else, which is better and why? What specific year and trim? <\/p>\n\n<p>Also considering entry luxury small-mid sedans like 2012+ Acura TSX\/TL\/TLX (v4) and 2014-2018 Volvo S60 but aware of increased costs to own and spotty reliability for newer Acura\/Volvo models. Open to Lexus since they\u2019re bulletproof, but for some reason prefer more subdued less common semi-luxury brands more, all else equal. May look into Genesis. <\/p>\n\n<p>History: Ive owned a 2005 Acura TL for over a decade. Been very reliable and about to hit 160k. Would\u2019ve kept going but now I\u2019m on the road for business, and want something more updated and client-presentable (TL is showing her age and has several dings and scratches from the years and from first owner). <\/p>\n\n<p>Warranty: Nice to have and open to CPO but not required. As long as car is reliable, and will use a third party mechanic to inspect for issues before purchase. Will use my trusty reputable mom&amp;pop mechanic for routine maintenance.<\/p>\n\n<p>Self-Maintenance: Little to none (ie change bulbs)<\/p>\n\n<p>Additional notes: Started a new job that requires me to take overnight road trips every so often. Emphasis on reliability, low costs to own, high safety ratings, good MPG. I do care about styling, driver\/ride comfort, performance and \u201cfun\u201d factor but they\u2019re secondary priorities. Definitely NOT open to German car brands off-warranty. Want a sensible sedan and don\u2019t want a rally sports car. <\/p>\n\n<p>I can afford a much higher pricepoint and more expensive maintenance as needed, but I see my Daily Driver as a deprecating asset and workhorse. I\u2019m content with an Asian brand \u201ceconobox\u201d. Also open to entry level luxury and other brands and models I haven\u2019t thought to consider yet. <\/p>\n\n<p>My height is 6\u20192 with a regular\/athletic build so I want to be comfortable for extended business road trips. Considering a Prius but nothing much smaller. <\/p>\n\n<p>I will be reimbursed for mileage and gas. Longer trips I\u2019ll fly.

I&#39;d like to keep the truck for occasional hauling and because it&#39;s just a super cool little truck with less than 100k miles on it.<\/p>\n\n<p>I love the Civic, but with a baby coming in January, we&#39;re worried about the logistics of transporting our baby and two medium sized dogs in one trip, which we&#39;ll likely need to do pretty frequently when visiting family or dropping them off for baby\/dogsitting.<\/p>\n\n<p>We&#39;re wanting to upgrade to something just big enough that we&#39;ll have enough cargo room to comfortably fit both dogs in the trunk (we don&#39;t want them squished up against the rear windshield like they&#39;d be in the Civic), so then the baby gets the whole backseat to himself, plus whatever other junk we need to bring along with us. <\/p>\n\n<p>Right now we have a backseat cover for the dogs to ride in the CIvic, but plenty of hair still winds up on the seats\/interior and I don&#39;t want lingering hair getting all over the baby. He&#39;ll need enough cleaning as it is.<\/p>\n\n<p>So far I&#39;ve mainly been looking at crossovers\/subcompact SUVs, &#39;cause I don&#39;t think we need to go thaaaaaaat much bigger and I&#39;m still wanting a lower cost, decently fuel efficient vehicle, since this&#39;ll also be what we use for any traveling. That said, we could go up to a compact SUV, I just haven&#39;t looked at those models as closely.<\/p>\n\n<p>We wouldn&#39;t be opposed to a hybrid either. I believe this category has some new hybrid entries, but I&#39;m just nervous like a lot of people about pulling the trigger on an EV before more people have made the transition and more charging stations are in place. <\/p>\n\n<p>But I guess it&#39;d probably be fine, right?
