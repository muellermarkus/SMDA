As a rock climber, I want something that can carry a good amount of gear (trunk space), is comfortable for a four hour drive, has a manual transmission, is fun, and can go over some gravel in the rain in a pinch. I want a convertible because that&#39;s just fun, particularly since everywhere I go climbing has excellent roads and beautiful summers. However, convertibles and storage space kinda don&#39;t go together. I would love the Wrangler, but I&#39;m just concerned about FCA reliability and the higher prices.<\/p>\n\n<p>My options: get a cheap Miata for shits and giggles, and keep my current beater. It&#39;s paid off and never breaks. Or, get a Mustang because it&#39;s still a convertible, while being more comfortable than the Miata. Or, get a Wrangler, to enjoy convertible and capability albeit with a much higher price tag. Probably would dump the Fusion in that case. Or, get the VW Alltrack because station wagons are cool in their own way, plus has incredible storage space and still some AWD capability, again dumping the Fusion.

I&#39;m sick of only having an automatic transmission and want to change that.  Money is a finite resource, but I want all the cars.  <\/p>\n\n<p>In an ideal world, I&#39;d have a two-car garage with a Cadillac CT6-V and Corvette ZR1.  A fast luxobarge for a daily, and extreme performance for the weekend.  But I don&#39;t have a $200,000 budget.  I have more like a $25,000 budget.<\/p>\n\n<p>For sale locally there are a couple cars that interest me:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>73k B8.5 6MT Audi S4 for $25k<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>56k C6 Z06 for $31k<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>75k C5 Z06 for $17k<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s my thoughts on the three:<\/p>\n\n<p>The S4 - The most practical car to have as my only car.  I can sell my G8 to help fund it.  Would be an amazing daily driver for winters in Minnesota, and is plenty fun for ordinary highway driving.  It&#39;s not impressively big, but I don&#39;t have rear passengers often.  Driving a manual everywhere might get tedious.  And lastly the cornering ability isn&#39;t incredible, but it probably still has plenty of fun even if the cornering ability isn&#39;t incredible.  I could always save up and buy a weekend car, but then there&#39;s some redundancy having two manual transmission cars.<\/p>\n\n<p>C6 Z06 - Stupid fast.  Also pretty expensive.  Idk if the extra $ over a C5 Z06 is worth it.  <\/p>\n\n<p>C5 Z06 - Plenty fast.  Could always throw a supercharger or camshaft in it to make it even faster.  Car is basically at the bottom of its depreciation curve.  Cheap enough to thrash at autocross or track days without feeling bad about it.  The low price point means I could save up for a luxobarge to replace my G8... or hell maybe even a pickup truck.<\/p>\n\n<p>One of the things that I&#39;m really torn on is I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d really enjoy having a big luxury vehicle as much as I think I will.  The Audi A8 4.0T and Cadillac CT6 3.0TT are pretty heavily depreciated and seem to offer a ton of value as daily drivers.  But do they really offer much to me over a car like my G8 or an S4?  <\/p>\n\n<p>I think I need to evaluate what I really want in a car.  I&#39;m just coming here for second opinions.<\/p>\n<\/div>","66":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[gel\u00f6scht]<\/p>\n<\/div>","67":"<div class=\"md\"><p>\u2022 Location: Austria\n \u2022 Price range: Max 18.000\u20ac\n \u2022 Lease or Buy: Buy\n \u2022 New or used: Used\n \u2022 Type of vehicle: Fun and interesting cars, doesn\u2019t have to be fast though I do prefer fast hatchbacks \n \u2022 Must haves: must be fun to drive \n \u2022 Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc): manual preferred but auto is ok too\n \u2022 Intended use: weekend car\n \u2022 Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered:<\/p>\n\n<p>Abarth  500     135  10.500,00 \u20ac <\/p>\n\n<p>Abarth  595     160  14.800,00 \u20ac<\/p>\n\n<p>Abarth  Punto       179  13.000,00 \u20ac<\/p>\n\n<p>Alfa Romeo  GTV     150  6.500,00 \u20ac<\/p>\n\n<p>Alfa Romeo  Spider      192  10.500,00 \u20ac<\/p>\n\n<p>Alfa Romeo  Spider      165  7.500,00 \u20ac<\/p>\n\n<p>Alfa Romeo  MiTo QV     170  6.500,00 \u20ac<\/p>\n\n<p>Alfa Romeo  Giuletta QV     235  13.000,00 \u20ac <\/p>\n\n<p>BMW 120i Cabrio\/Coup\u00e9      170  13.000,00 \u20ac <\/p>\n\n<p>BMW 125i Cabrio\/Coup\u00e9      218  15.000,00 \u20ac <\/p>\n\n<p>BMW 325i Cabrio\/Coup\u00e9      218  13.500,00 \u20ac <\/p>\n\n<p>BMW 330i Cabrio\/Coup\u00e9      231  13.000,00 \u20ac <\/p>\n\n<p>Ford    Focus ST        250  12.500,00 \u20ac <\/p>\n\n<p>Ford    Fiesta ST       200  16.500,00 \u20ac <\/p>\n\n<p>Ford    Fiesta ST       182  12.000,00 \u20ac<\/p>\n\n<p>Jaguar  XKR     284  13.500,00 \u20ac <\/p>\n\n<p>Mazda   3 MPS       260  13.500,00 \u20ac<\/p>\n\n<p>Mercedes    SLK 200     163  13.500,00 \u20ac <\/p>\n\n<p>Mercedes    SLK 350     270  15.000,00 \u20ac <\/p>\n\n<p>Mini    Cooper S        174  8.000,00 \u20ac <\/p>\n\n<p>Mini    Cooper S        184  11.500,00 \u20ac <\/p>\n\n<p>Nissan  350Z        280  15.500,00 \u20ac <\/p>\n\n<p>Opel    Adam S      150  12.500,00 \u20ac <\/p>\n\n<p>Peugeot     208 GTI     208  17.000,00 \u20ac<\/p>\n\n<p>Seat    Ibiza Cupra     192  13.000,00 \u20ac <\/p>\n\n<p>Seat    Ibiza Cupra     179  12.500,00 \u20ac <\/p>\n\n<p>Toyota  MR2     156  7.600,00 \u20ac <\/p>\n\n<p>Toyota  MR 2        140  10.000,00 \u20ac <\/p>\n\n<p>VW  up!

And the Pacifica has been my favorite minivan in recent years. The plug-in hybrid is a pretty unique vehicle, with a usable electric-only range for shuttling family members around town, though you do miss out on Stow n Go seats, which are only available with gas-only models. In the US, you get federal tax credits for buying a plug-in hybrid like the Pacifica PHEV, and I&#39;m assuming Canada has something similar. I will say, some folks have had minor issues and glitches with the Pacifica plug-in, so look around online for what problems folks have run into before deciding whether it&#39;s for you or not. It&#39;s just about the only plug-in people mover that meets your needs, for now!<\/p>\n\n<p>If you end up checking out SUVs, the Kia Telluride and Hyundai Palisade are my favorites on the market, but the newly redesigned Toyota Highlander is an improvement on the previous model and comes with a great hybrid
