I havent had a daily driver under 700 rwhp for the last 10 years. I modify basically anything I buy to the point its almost undrivable - but I like that. Last car was a Camaro, I had the first one in my entire city, and within a few weeks of it arriving I had a supercharger and a camshaft in it. Currently daily driving a 9 second c6 with a tank of methanol in the trunk. I&#39;m not practical.<\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m getting a bit tired of the c6 though as I swear its a lemon or something. Everything is breaking and nothing that is breaking has to do with the power or mods. Its just falling apart. I&#39;m getting ready to have to replace the differential (which is because of the power, actually) and I&#39;m just about done with it. I&#39;m going to keep it and probably eventually turn it into a strict race-only vehicle, but I wont be driving it on the street anymore.<\/p>\n\n<p>I want something interesting, fun, and can be modded to a useful degree. Sure you can put a turbo on a miata, but I&#39;m not spending $4000 to get 200rwhp, for example. I want a platform that is actually worth the time. I dont want a mustang or a challenger because I&#39;ve already had the Camaro and I feel its basically the same thing. I&#39;ve tossed around the idea of a VERY used Gallardo and then putting turbos on it in the future, but I feel like the dollar:fun ratio just isnt there, hence why I&#39;m having a hard time with this. The C63 can be modded to a 9s car for about $8000, which is great, but it isnt a very exciting car. Same thing with the GTR. I drove a stock GTR and a 800hp GTR back to back and couldnt even tell the difference between the two because it is such a boring vehicle.
