Hoping this is right place to ask this. I didn\u2019t want to top post in the sub.     Looking at downsizing the household cars  to just one from two (Accord and CRV) and wondering which one makes more sense economically to get rid of.   First car is accord \u201816 EX-L 4c CVT. 27k. Bought extended warranty (Route 66. 5y\/100k warranty).  (Being financed) Also have winter tires I bought separately.   Second car is CRV EX-L \u201817. 4L turbo.  This one is still leased but only driven 6k out of a 36k lease and 1y left on the lease .  (Accord also has a few cosmetic scratches that id have to fix).  My thinking is to buy out the CRV lease early and sell it privately.  Because it\u2019s so low on miles we can prob sell it and earn a premium. While at the same time the accord already has the winter tires etc  that we wouldn\u2019t have to buy again and fixing the cosmetics would be upfront costs.  Higher mileage shouldn\u2019t be an issue because I have the warranty on it (though I think I can prob get for that warranty a prorated refund. Not sure;  maybe it would help sell the accord for more? ).  Accord is also better for road trips in my experience even tho CRV has the standard Honda sensing and traffic aware cruise (\u201816 accord doesn\u2019t). The accord is better on fuel and has a bigger tank. Sorry to digress with actual car comparison.  I like the accord a lot more but am Mainly interested in opinions about which path makes more sense economically, ignoring car difference.  Oh and mileage going forward would be much lower. Maybe 5k not including any road trips.    Thank you.   Money wise, both cars are just under $400\/m for the loan and the lease.    Thank you so much for any input. \/\/\/ edit.

I want something that&#39;s pretty reliable since I already have an E92 335 that I beat the hell out of, so it would be nice to have a backup when I&#39;m in between projects on that car. I also want something that I can use to tow. I don&#39;t mind doing some work on a car so I&#39;ll probably look for something with body rust or minor mechanical problems to save some money.
