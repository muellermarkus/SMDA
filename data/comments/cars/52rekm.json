The prius has better visibility inside, more space, and better gas mileage. The Sportwagen is sort of close in MPG and has a ton more pick-up. My main concern is VW reliability vs. the Prius. My perception of VW is that they&#39;re not very reliable and I&#39;ll pay more for typical repairs\/maintenance. Anyone have thoughts?
