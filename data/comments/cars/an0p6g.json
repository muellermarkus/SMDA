This &quot;warm hatch&quot; feels like the most lateral move from my Fiesta ST, with moderate gains in trunk and seat space while still being a fun turbo manual. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cars.com\/articles\/2018-hyundai-elantra-gt-car-seat-check-1420697503213\/\">Good car seat ratings<\/a>. Wife thinks still too small, I disagree. She needs to see it in person.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>New Buick Regal TourX - Love the look of this car. A little above my price range but is a contender depending on dealer incentives. I&#39;ve seen loaded 2018s in my area for around 30k (nearly 10k under MSRP) and 0% for 72 months. Based on reviews, the upshift-happy gearbox and always-on auto-stop are in the negative column. Pretty big, might not quite fit in my garage.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Used Subaru Outback - What my wife think I should get. Used, because a baby will probably mess it up anyway. Subaru, because safety &amp; reliability(?). They don&#39;t really trip my trigger (especially the CVT), but not entirely opposed to them either. Maybe drive this for a few years then get another fun hot hatch.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Used VW Golf Alltrack or Jetta Sportwagen - They look super practical but also very boring. Definitely the cheapest option. Again, maybe a stop gap til another hot hatch. There&#39;s a TDI manual listed nearby that seems kind of interesting.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Of course, drooling over what they get outside of the US like the Mazda6 Wagon, Focus Active, and Opel Insignia Sports Tourer (TourX w\/o the black plastic).<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Just saw the new 2019 Mazda 3 design.

It is a lot easier to get a mid-sized truck with 4x4 versus a full-sized truck in a lot of places.  You...CAN do it with a Tundra, but you&#39;d probably get stuck in a few places.  Smaller with 4x4 is a lot easier in this case, I just talked to one of my buddies who is big into over-landing and he confimed this.  Jeeps Wranglers would be good but they <strong>do not<\/strong> have the towing you need.  The new Jeep Gladiators coming out are supposed to have really good towing along with all of the normal Jeep Wrangler things.<\/p>\n\n<p>You could purchase these vehicles new today for around the same price. a 2019 Toyota Tacoma V6 4x4 is ~$32k, a 2019 Ford Ranger 4x4 is ~$32k and the 2019 Chevy Colorado 4x4 is ~$32k.  They all have roughly 6500-7500 lbs of towing.
