Over the course of 2 years I expect to drive to off-site rotations 60 miles away about 35 times and do trips to nearby cities (150 mi) about 25 times. After 2 years I don\u2019t know where I\u2019ll be or whether I\u2019ll even need a car anymore. I\u2019m also pretty certain that I\u2019d want to get a Tesla Model 3 in about 2.5 years when I\u2019ll be making twice of what I am now. I\u2019m unsure of how much to budget, whether to buy new\/used\/lease especially given I expect my first car to be temporary. I\u2019m currently leaning towards buying a ~3 year old certified pre-owned car that\u2019s widely proclaimed to be reliable. I live alone and don&#39;t own furniture so car size isn&#39;t a big issue. I think lease might have been a good idea for me as well, but doing the math on online quotes, many seem to sum out to more than the depreciation value of the car. However, if I buy the car I might need to sell it off before I\u2019m done paying off the monthly installments. From my limited understanding, this is possible but much harder than having actually purchased the car.<br\/>\nI\u2019m a foreign national and know very little about cars beyond the reddit guides and internet research over the last few days.

I have a buddy who&#39;s looking to replace his aging VW Golf, and he loves absolutely everything about the new Civic Hatchback, but he can&#39;t get over the looks, so he won&#39;t do it. It&#39;s a fair perspective; you&#39;re the one who has to look at your car every day, you want something that will be aesthetically pleasing.<\/p>\n\n<p>In the &quot;Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered,&quot; three classes are represented: subcompacts, compacts, and tiny crossovers. We want to find a vehicle that you like the looks of while also being a solid vehicle.<\/p>\n\n<p>First, subcompacts: The Hyundai Accent is inexpensive, fuel efficient, and comfortable. Sadly, it&#39;s not particularly fun to drive, the engine is somewhat old and relatively slow, and the automatic transmission can get annoying, in my opinion. But it&#39;s a fine car if you aren&#39;t worried about how it drives. In my opinion, some better and more well-rounded options in this class include the Toyota Yaris iA (the sedan, not the Yaris hatchback), Honda Fit, Ford Fiesta, and Chevrolet Sonic. If you like the looks of any of those, let me know and I&#39;ll tell you more about it.<\/p>\n\n<p>Next: compacts. The Ford Focus used to be the best compact on the market. It&#39;s still one of the better ones, and certainly worth looking at if you find one that meets your needs. Other compacts that are worth looking at are the Honda Civic, Volkwagen Golf, Mazda 3, Chevrolet Cruze, and Hyundai Elantra.<\/p>\n\n<p>Lastly: Tiny crossovers. The Juke gets a lot of flack for its looks from the Internet as a whole, but it&#39;s actually a pretty great vehicle. It&#39;s fun to drive and has a solid powertrain. I&#39;m particularly fond of the Juke Nismo, though I have a feeling its design won&#39;t please you all that much. There are a few other crossovers that are worth considering, namely the Kia Soul, Mazda CX-3, and the Kia Niro (one of the first hybrid crossovers I&#39;ve been legitimately excited about).<\/p>\n\n<p>Again, if any of these other models interest you, let me know and I&#39;ll help you dive into them a bit.<\/p>\n<\/div>","113":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Any thoughts on the Ford C-Max
