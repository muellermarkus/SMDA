It&#39;s almost  as heavy as my car and that bothers me, but it&#39;s got an appeal like none other, not to mention they&#39;re getting cheap (85k). <\/p>\n\n<p>The GT4 is the other contender I&#39;ve looked at and I haven&#39;t ever driven a manual on a track so I&#39;m kinda nervous I&#39;d fuck something up. Price is very similar to the GTS and might even drop more once the 718 GT4 gets released.<\/p>\n\n<p>The 911.1 GTS felt very similar in terms of straight line performance to my car, it was fast but not blistering, throw your head back into the seat, fast. Obviously it was a corner king though which outshines my car any day of the week. These are going for around 100k right now, so I&#39;m real curious how it compares to a GT4 on the track. PDK is also a bonus. Also, I&#39;ve noticed some 911.1 Turbos have dropped to a very similar price.<\/p>\n\n<p>The 911.1 GT3 is the car I want but when I compare it to the AMG GTS, I don&#39;t see it being worth 40k more. Performance is similar, and I felt more confident when I drove it since it&#39;s obviously lighter than the GTS. But 40k more? It&#39;s a steep price. <\/p>\n\n<p>My other option I suppose is to get a Cayman S and mod the hell out of it, but I&#39;m not to thrilled about a 4 banger. I guess my real question is to AMG GTS owners or people who&#39;ve driven it on a track -- is the weight something that is just a learning curve or do you have to manage it constantly? How often do you need to switch tires?<\/p>\n<\/div>","10":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[gel\u00f6scht]<\/p>\n<\/div>","11":"<div class=\"md\"><p>\u2022 Location: Kansas, USA<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Price range: $10k-$17k USD<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Lease or Buy: buy<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 New or used: used<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Type of vehicle: open to any<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Must haves: NO FWD, good sound system, decent speed.

Is there a place better than here to ask all of them?<\/p>\n\n<hr\/>\n\n<p>Here are the questions if any of you can answer anyways though:<\/p>\n\n<p>Just for some background. I will 100% be getting a manual (largely just because I like them, though i head the auto trans in these trucks sucked anyways), I plan to get an xtra cab either way, a bed north of 6&#39;, and very likely 4x4.<\/p>\n\n<p>The first questions are on engines. 22RE is said to be sluggish, but my question is just how sluggish. I drive a 74&#39; beetle with like 35 HP, and I dont care if the car super zippy, but I absolutely want higher cruising speeds and a <em>bit<\/em> more power than that since it will be my dd. Thoughts on the 22RET? I cant find much info on it at all. As for the 6-cy 3L (forget the designation), people tend to just shit on it all the time online, but of the 4 people I know that have owned yota trucks of that era, they all said that the v6 realy did have quite a bit more power when they test drove both at dealerships. I wont be towing, but will load it down with lots of stuff when I camp, so what you your thoughts on it? How much more am I looking in general maintenance over the 22RE? I can do most general maintenance myself (and everything outside of the engine and electrical is 100% in my skill set).<\/p>\n\n<p>The second set is on safety of sorts. I know safety regulations were largely rewritten in the 80s, but the redesign happened at the beginning of the 90s. Are the early 90s trucks much safer than the late 80s ones? Honestly, I think this will play a much lesser role in my decision (I do drive the airbagless tin can that is called a beetle currently after all), but I would like to know.<\/p>\n\n<p>The last is of practicality. People that have owned a late 80s xtra cab, does it actually give you much more room at all? I realize that that 90s have fold down seats, which is part of my consideration, but most commonly it will just be a place for me to put my gym bag and backpack so I dont have to go get them out of the bed all the time. Also, Does the late 80s seat 3 on the front seat? I had a buddy with an 82 that did, but his car was so sketchy he may have just put in the extra lap belt himself.<\/p>\n<\/div>","82":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[gel\u00f6scht]<\/p>\n<\/div>","83":"<div class=\"md\"><p><strong>Location:<\/strong> San Diego, CA<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Price range:<\/strong> $3000 or less<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Lease or Buy:<\/strong> Buy<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>New or used:<\/strong> Used<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Type of vehicle:<\/strong> Sedan<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Must haves:<\/strong> Fuel efficient, Trunk space, RWD, Air Conditioning, a little fun<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Desired transmission:<\/strong> Auto, with the option for a swap?<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Intended use:<\/strong> Daily driver that can make one trip from Cali to Texas this summer<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered:<\/strong> Ford Crown Vic, Lincoln Town Car, Lexus LS 400, Chevy Impala, Mercedes E Class<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Is this your 1st vehicle:<\/strong> Yes<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you need a Warranty:<\/strong> Nope<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> Yeeeup<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> Planning on learning to do this over the summer, so I wouldn&#39;t mind a car that&#39;d need some work, as long as it can make the drive<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Additional Notes:<\/strong> San Diego to Dallas is 1150 Miles, and this summer is looking to be one of the hottest in the southwest in a while.<\/p>\n<\/div>","84":"<div class=\"md\"><p>If I\u2019m getting a cheap car (sub 3,000) should I even consider one that needs a timing belt replaced?<\/p>\n<\/div>","85":"<div class=\"md\"><p>In the entire history of my car which is at 155k miles right now, I have accidentally done two light <strong>neutral drops<\/strong>, second one being today.
