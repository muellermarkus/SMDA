I actually started the process on Carvana for a 2011 987 Boxster S in racing green which is my dream color, but it was not well optioned and after much deliberation, cancelled the order. This car will hopefully be my daily for a decade +, and I thought buying an older generation car with virtually no modern tech would eventually be something I regret, particularly when factoring in the cost of retrofits\/upgrades. The 987 also had very few options - not even the sport chrono package.<\/p>\n\n<p>Additionally, I have a racing yellow 987 Boxster S being shipped for a free test drive with CarMax. That car has the sport chrono package, but no suspension or exhaust options. And my wife isn&#39;t a fan of a racing yellow car :). I&#39;ll test drive it, but likely won&#39;t be buying it.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, I saw a post on Rennlist for a beautiful Aqua Blue Metallic 2013 981 Boxster S. 21,700 miles, $43,900 and totally loaded - PASM, PSE, Sport Chrono, SportDesign steering wheel, 18 way seats, premium package, PDLS, ventilated seats and more. It&#39;s a beautiful car in fantastic condition and the owner has all service records. Like I said, I hope it goes well and I can close the deal.<\/p>\n\n<p>A big thank you to everyone who has helped me on a several month long search!<\/p>\n<\/div>","1":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Location:<\/strong> California, USA  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Price range:<\/strong> 100-200k (can go a bit higher for the right car)  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Lease or Buy: Lease<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>New or used: Either<\/strong>   <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Type of vehicle:<\/strong> No preference (no two seaters)  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Must haves:<\/strong> Leather, good infotainment, and Fun to drive   <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc): either (preferably automatic )<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Intended use: Company car<\/strong>   <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: Haven&#39;t gave much thought into it.<\/strong>   <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Is this your 1st vehicle: No<\/strong>   <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you need a Warranty: Yes<\/strong>   <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> Yes  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> No  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Additional Notes: Looking for a fun car but also practical enough (no two seaters)<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<\/div>","2":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: Central Texas<\/p>\n\n<p>Price range: &lt;$15k<\/p>\n\n<p>Lease or Buy: Buy<\/p>\n\n<p>New or used: Used<\/p>\n\n<p>Type of vehicle: Car, coupe or sedan<\/p>\n\n<p>Must haves: Probably not a turbo for something older.

I&#39;d probably sit on a small pillow if I had to drive her car for an extended period of time. In the ~2018 Subaru Forester and 2021 Subaru Outback XT (two other family cars), I did not need to use a pillow. Obviously, this makes me lean toward Subarus but the Golf and Mazda seem cool.

My biggest no-no is those SUVS that seem to actually offer less space than my existing tiny Honda Fit.<\/li>\n<li>I don&#39;t like big for big&#39;s sake. While I&#39;m not a truck guy, I&#39;m intrigued by the the Ridgeline. It seems like a truck for non-truck guys. As younger homeowners we do the occasional Home Depot\/IKEA\/Facebook Marketplace run, and having a truck bed would stop us calling friends\/renting Uhauls. Also would help for our camping trips. Tacoma seems fine too, but overwhelming options and sounds like the Ridgeline is a more comfortable daily drive.<\/li>\n<li>As a European ex-pat in the US, I have some soft spot for Wagons that&#39;ll give me the cargo space I desire. Subarus\/VWs\/Audis don&#39;t seem to give much bang for buck and their relative rarity may make shopping harder.<\/li>\n<li>Like many people, I think Wranglers and Gladiators look cool, but I hear the ride quality is pretty terrible for the price.<\/li>\n<li>I like the idea of electric cars (could stretch to a Model 3?), but the charging still seems impractical to me.<\/li>\n<li>In case it comes up: I&#39;m comfortable with a lease. I do okay, I like shopping for a new car every three years, finances are otherwise in order. I&#39;ve budgeted for it.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>","82":"<div class=\"md\"><p>First, you should pick a car that is suitable or good for you, a coupe, an SUV or a pickup you know!<\/p>\n\n<p>Secondly,
