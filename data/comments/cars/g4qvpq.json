I play the markets, always look at commodity prices\/speculation so let me warn you now. Cheap gas is going to be followed by a crushing upsurge in price once big oil consolidates because all the small fish have gone bankrupt. Don&#39;t fall into the trap of buying a 12mpg guzzler that you don&#39;t actually need if you are banking on it keeping it as your main vehicle for the next 5-7 years. I figure you&#39;ll have 1.5-3 years of cheap-ish gas at best. It might even spike sooner than that if companies and people go a little overboard trying to make up for lost time. Just my .2, hope you all stay healthy.<\/p>\n<\/div>","1":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Okay so after looking at a lot of cars I&#39;ve started to narrow things down.  Weekend RWD sports coupe.  Removable hard top preferred, fixed hard top is okay, soft top not preferred.  Budget up to $25k but cheaper is always preferred.<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Honda S2000 - I drove one last weekend and was amazed by how much room it has compared to a Miata.  Due to title issues I didn&#39;t buy, but there&#39;s a 2005 AP2 a few hours from me with an OEM hardtop and 160000 miles for $12500 that I&#39;m leaning toward, but the high mileage has me worried.  I&#39;d be extremely interested in a supercharger, but I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s worth spending $6000+ adding forced induction to a car with so many miles.  Due to hardtop rarity, I&#39;m fairly opposed to buying a car without a hardtop and praying I find one on the second hand market.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Porsche 987 - More refined and comfortable than the S2000.  I haven&#39;t been able to drive one yet unfortunately.  There&#39;s a 2006 Cayman S near me for $20k.  70,000 miles.  My reservations about the Cayman are mainly the purchase price, maintenance costs, and no removable hard top.  <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Saturn Sky Redline - Seems to be a nice S2000 alternative.  Aftermarket hardtops aren&#39;t terribly expensive.  Maintenance might be an issue because of how rare they are.  No aftermarket.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Nissan 370Z - Seems like a budget Cayman S with less refinements.  3200 lb curb weight is one of the heaviest cars I&#39;m considering.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>C5 Z06 - Incredible value, but possibly faster than what I can responsibly use.  I already have my G8 for V8 torque and straightline speed.  But again, the value is difficult to pass up.  3200lb curb weight with an even larger wheelbase than the 370Z.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>No longer considering:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Scion FRS - I don&#39;t want a 2+2 coupe for a weekend car.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Miata - Too small for my 6&#39;1&quot; frame.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>","2":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Hi all,<\/p>\n\n<p>I recently came across 2 mustangs and I\u2019m having a hard time deciding between the two<\/p>\n\n<p>They are both coupe GT premium\u2019s with 401A, active exhaust, and cali special package<\/p>\n\n<p>One is a White 2019 with 15k miles listed for 33k, the other is a new black 2020 for 40k<\/p>\n\n<p>15k miles seems high for one year of ownership, and I\u2019m wary of buying mustangs used because of potential abuse.

I&#39;m in uni so it needs to be somewhat reliable and cheap to own although I can do minor work on it myself. Don&#39;t care about hp, if its a manual or auto, etc. Just cheap, reliable and good in the snow. And a decent interior would be nice.

Don&#39;t get me wrong I love everything about the car but I&#39;ve always been a restrained driver on streets so as to not attract unwanted attention and I do not track the car. I&#39;m a backroad\/canyon carver 100% and on backroad drives the Z06 is great but even I can tell that If I had a Grand Sport or something fun but less powerful I&#39;d still be having just as much fun as I am in the Z06.<\/p>\n\n<p>The second reason is that Porsche&#39;s, GT cars especially, simply will retain more value then a Corvette ever will and this matters to me because I have a bad habit of jumping from 1 car to the next so the more equity still in the vehicle the better. I know the 718 GT4 is more readily available then the last one and this means that the resale is certainly going to be nowhere near as absurd but it should still easily hold more value then the Z06.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now since the GT4 is obviously much more expensive then the Z06 I&#39;d also have to get rid of the Stinger for something much cheaper. Personally, I&#39;m ok with this, I was looking at getting rid of the Stinger anyway so its not a huge deal to me. <\/p>\n\n<p>My main concern is that I&#39;ve always been a V8 guy and never a Porsche guy. I appreciate what Porsche builds and I know they make fabulous cars but emotionally I&#39;ve always been more more of the American V8 crowd. I&#39;ve never driven a Porsche but I&#39;m sure I&#39;d love it.<\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m also aware that the GT4 and a C7 Z06 are fundamentally two different sports cars, ones a brute with power, the other is light and nimble but I&#39;ve yet to experience a light and nimble car and with a GT4 opportunity in front of me, its hard to ignore.<\/p>\n<\/div>","34":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: (Specify your country or region) Texas<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Price range: (Minimum-Maximum in your local currency) $20k-$25k<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Lease or Buy: Buy<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 New or used: New or 2018+<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Type of vehicle: Sedan or Hatchback<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Must haves: Reliability.

You either have to go down to a less luxurious brand which brings its own sacrifices, or go to a bigger car. The Mazda maybe fits the niche but their infotainment is awful and that\u2019s a sticking point that probably trumps the ability to have vented seats. The Lincoln hits most everything (infotainment is passable) but you pay a premium and the drive won\u2019t be as good as the Q3 or X1 unless I spend lots more on options (more power, configurable dynamics). <\/p>\n\n<p>So am I missing anything, or do I have to spend more and get into a larger car for vented seats?
