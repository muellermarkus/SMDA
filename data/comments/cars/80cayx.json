I commute to work by bus, so it&#39;s more of a weekly driver.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Vehicles considered already:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>ND Miata RF.  I love the way this looks and supposedly it drives amazingly.  Plus, it&#39;s loads cheaper than everything else on this list.  A little concerned about how it would do in the rain\/winter, and concerned the novelty would wear off.<\/li>\n<li>Lightly preowned M2: I love small cars with big engines.  This one looks great but is a little pricey.  Also I&#39;m afraid it would be a money pit to maintain, and am a little concerned about winter driving.<\/li>\n<li>Lightly pre-owned RS3: Same deal as the M2, love the style, love the interior.  Don&#39;t love the price.  AWD is nice because I like skiing.<\/li>\n<li>M235i or M240i: Cheaper than the M2, seems a little bit less overkill (not that I don&#39;t like the M2, I love it, this just seems like a reasonable alternative).  Comes with XDrive, which is nice.<\/li>\n<li>2014 ish BMW 4 series:  More car than the 2 series, great styling, less money than the M2 with more engine than the M235\/M240.  Also comes with XDrive.<\/li>\n<li>Golf R: I&#39;ve wanted a GTI since I was a kid and I&#39;ve wanted a WRX STI since I was a kid. This is the lovechild of both.  Plus its cheaper than the BMW\/Audis.<\/li>\n<li>2012 ish Porsche Boxster\/Cayman S:  Supposedly these are pretty reliable, and I have a coworker who is absolutely in love with these.  I love the specs and the style, but they are hard to find in the price range.

That was about 60k miles ago. Currently the car needs a new exhaust and probably a new battery. It has some difficulty starting up in cooler weather and burns a bit of oil so I suspect there&#39;s a compression leak somewhere, so we think it&#39;s time to replace it with something newer. It isn&#39;t unusual for her to put a couple hundred miles per day on the car, and she often sleeps in her car. She does need a bit of cargo space to hold her clothes, laptop, toiletries, etc. AWD would be nice for when she&#39;s driving in rain or snow. Keep in mind that she is the exact polar opposite of a &quot;car person&quot; and does no maintenance on her car until\/unless she&#39;s reminded to do it. She buys wiper blades at Pep Boys so they&#39;ll install them for her, for example.<\/p>\n<\/div>","63":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: Kentucky<\/p>\n\n<p>Price Range: 3k - ~6k USD<\/p>\n\n<p>Lease or Buy: Buy<\/p>\n\n<p>New or Used: Used<\/p>\n\n<p>Type of Vehicle: Car\/sedan\/hatchback<\/p>\n\n<p>Must haves: power steering, locks, windows, sunroof\/moonroof would be nice, fuel efficiency would be nice, 4 doors, decently quick, leather and heated seats would be nice, reliability (200k-300k miles), low cost to maintain<\/p>\n\n<p>Desired trans: auto<\/p>\n\n<p>Intended use: Daily Driver ~30 miles a day total (maybe less)<\/p>\n\n<p>Vehicles you\u2019ve already considered: 2010-2012 Ford Fusion, first gen Mazda 6, 2007-2012 Camry, 2007-12 Honda Accord (learning towards the ford and Mazda, open to others though)<\/p>\n\n<p>Is this your first vehicle: No<\/p>\n\n<p>Do you need a warranty: No but it would be nice <\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do minor work on your own vehicle: some but not all<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do major work on your own vehicle: No<\/p>\n\n<p>Additional notes: really like the 10-12 Ford Fusions and first gen Mazda 6\u2019s.

Trying to keep a relatively cheap lease payment with a really solid luxury car. I do get Chrysler employee discount which could be applied on Alfa Romeo&#39;s. And Ford employee for Lincoln&#39;s. <\/p>\n\n<p>I also don&#39;t care too much on performance, besides speed. It doesn&#39;t have to be a rocket ship, but I&#39;m coming from a V6 Jeep Grand Cherokee so I bet any of these are already faster. <\/p>\n<\/div>","101":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[gel\u00f6scht]<\/p>\n<\/div>","102":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: austria, Europe <\/p>\n\n<p>Price range 30-34k \u20ac<\/p>\n\n<p>lease or buy: used car\/young car , no lease.<\/p>\n\n<p>Type : coupe\/sports car <\/p>\n\n<p>Must have: reliability and definetly not a diesel(preferably rear drive)<\/p>\n\n<p>transmission: manual<\/p>\n\n<p>intended use: Daily driver\/ fun car<\/p>\n\n<p>Vehicles i have already considered: Abart fiata, Miata 160hp , gt86 <\/p>\n\n<p>is this your first vehicle: no.<\/p>\n\n<p>Do you need a waranty: would be good.<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do minor work: sure as hell i can.<\/p>\n\n<p>Major work: no.<\/p>\n\n<p>Minor notes: i dislike BMWs design, it shouldnt have too much HP.<\/p>\n<\/div>","103":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: U.S.<\/p>\n\n<p>Price range: $28-36k<\/p>\n\n<p>Lease or Buy: Either, but prefer buy.<\/p>\n\n<p>New or used: Either, but likely used.<\/p>\n\n<p>Type of vehicle: &quot;Sports&quot; car.<\/p>\n\n<p>Must haves: Not looking for a track star, but something (modded or not) that can put down good power when I need it (500hp+) but not sacrifice its capability to be daily driven.

I was thinking about getting a 2SS and slapping a Procharger, exhaust, and tune on it so it basically drives as stock below 3XXX RPM, but above that, it will really pull.  Problem is, I&#39;m not sure how well the stock internals can handle it and whether or not I should just buy one already modded how I like.  I&#39;ve never purchased a modded car, but I feel if it&#39;s low-miles and they have receipts to prove work from reputable shops, it&#39;ll be okay.  <\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m open to anything else you guys can throw at me.
