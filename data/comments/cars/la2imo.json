Although it&#39;s older than I want, it&#39;s also at the lower point of my budget and it ticks a lot of boxes (can also tow suffici\u00ebnt enough).   <\/p>\n\n<p>Seat Ibiza, looked like a smart choice because it&#39;s light and large enough, but the newer models (2013) are already too expensive with the low mileage I want. People say they are fun to drive, which is a pro, but with Seat I have no personal experience. The interior looks as cheap as my current Fiat punto, and I decided that the amount I would be paying  would only get me something newer, and maybe faster but it&#39;s price is too close to an MX-5, which is my dream car, that I could every buy this car.   <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Is this your 1st vehicle:<\/strong> No, my third. My first was a MX-5 NA (1996) which I loved in every possible way but had to go because of rust and lack of sufficient income. Second and current is a Fiat Punto of which I&#39;m impressed by the quality of the interior in a bad way, but besides that is very cheap. The bad is not giving the driver any form of pleasure from driving, the steering is so dead that it makes me feel less safe driving it, than driving my MX-5 NA which was 9 years older and objectively the less safe vehicle. The 60 horse power creates a need to rev it all the way just to get on the highway and that&#39;s also the only fun part of the car, it feels like it want&#39;s you to do it. It&#39;s from 2005, has airco and a towing hook and very light (which means low taxes<br\/>\n<strong>Do you need a Warranty:<\/strong> No, but preferred for vehicles at the top of my price range.<br\/>\n<strong>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> Wanting to, but still have to learn the most, so assume only fluids and the most simple things to be done by myself.<br\/>\n<strong>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> No, that would result in catastrophic failures.<br\/>\n<strong>Additional Notes:<\/strong> I love convertibles and the MX-5, but want to look further. Because of the taxe system, most convertibles are no option because they are a lot heavier. And for those that are not heavy, they are probably too old to consider. I do not have very strong safety concerns with a vehicle, but since I&#39;m mostly not traveling alone anymore, I do not want a convertible that would be flat after a turnover, like the MX-5 NA.   <\/p>\n\n<p>Further, which may seem strange, but there are a couple of options. My dream car, the Mazda MX-5, which is too expensive but due to low fixed costs stil feels like an option. I cannot get this out of my mind. This would also be the fun choice.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Then there is the wise choice, which in my mind would be the Seat Ibiza. Low in fixed costs, but for those models that are really an upgrade from my 2005 Punto MKII, they are too expensive for what I&#39;m getting. It&#39;s like the lower mileage I demand for cheaper brands are increasing the costs too much.  <\/p>\n\n<p>The best choices for now are:<br\/>\n[A] Do nothing, I would keep my Fiat Punto even though the 160.000km&#39;s are giving me reliability concerns and I always have had safety concerns in the car. It&#39;s a 1.2 Petrol engine with an non-impressive 60horsepower that feel like even less and a fuel consumption that&#39;s higher than the Mercedes C180 (2013) from my parents.<br\/>\n[B] Make the wise choice (above) and accept not getting a convertible for the next two years or something  <\/p>\n\n<p>[C] Search for a low mileage Astra G cabriolet, weight is acceptable, fuel consumption is fine, I know how it drives, it has a relatively large trunk for a convertible, and with some luck I may be getting al the options like heated seats, air conditioning and a towing hook and all for much less than an MX-5 NC, and only sacrificing the fun to drive-ness.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<\/div>","108":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I think the 2021 Ford escape is a great option!
