After test driving the car drove pretty good and looked great. I wanted to check carfax before buying it but my friend used a free website to check if miles were rolled back or not and said checking carfax wasn\u2019t necessary. So I trusted him and bought it. I still had a gut feeling so the next day I made another friend run the VIN for me and the carfax said it was a total loss, even though the vehicle was issued a new clean title recently. The car was hit in the rear drivers side corner and was fixed and now you can hardly tell. <\/p>\n\n<p>I contacted the seller that he didn\u2019t disclose the info to me, but it was already too late and he won\u2019t return my money since I should have checked carfax as a responsible buyer before buying it. So i contacted DMV and they said it is a clean title vehicle. However, when I took it to the dealership, they ran their auto check reports, and said the car was worth only $1000 to them since it is a total loss vehicle. On top of that, the car needs maintenance done which is gonna cost me almost $1000 such as changing wheel bearing, bent rim, and control arms. <\/p>\n\n<p>I honestly do not know what to do with the car now. I don\u2019t have the money to fix it and dealerships won\u2019t take the car as a trade in so that I can buy something cheaper. The car has a good engine tho, and should run good if I fix those, but then again I am also worried about the resale value down the road.<\/p>\n\n<p>Can y\u2019all please tell me more about such an issue and what can be done? <\/p>\n\n<p>Thank you.<\/p>\n<\/div>","7":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Location:<\/strong> Northeast Florida  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Price range:<\/strong> $50,000-$80,000  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Lease or Buy: Buy<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>New or used: New (or maybe low mileage CPO)<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Type of vehicle:<\/strong> SUV  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Must haves:<\/strong> Feature-rich  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc): Auto<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Intended use:<\/strong> Daily Driver, Family Car,  Long distance Traveling (from Florida to Northeast)  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: Escalade, Lexus GX,  Navigator, CPO Lexus LX, BMW X7,  MB GLS, Range Rover<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Is this your 1st vehicle: No<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you need a Warranty: Yes<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> Some minor work (fluids,, battery) but this is for my father   <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> No  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Additional Notes: We have had a Sequoia for 230,000 miles and looking for another SUV now to replace it.

I like to take public transportation and hope to find a job in an area with a relatively robust transportation system so that on most occasions my daily commute is relatively short to a park and ride but has the room that a hatchback or small suv  provides to shove an entire dorm rooms worth of stuff into it or all those IKEA purchases. Ride isn&#39;t all that important to me as I understand that short wheelbases make bumps more pronounced, I just want it to be comfortable enough that I can occasionally drive a few hours down the interstate without having to get out and stretch because my legs are cramping or back is hurting. I&#39;m also a bit of an aggressive driver and like to take corners at speed that&#39;s why I want a lower center of gravity due to US market not having many hatchback options it but plenty of compact suvs.<\/p>\n<\/div>","36":"<div class=\"md\"><p><strong>Location:<\/strong> Southern California<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Price range:<\/strong> Ideally, ~$10,000 (but willing to spend up to $13,000 if need be)<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Lease or Buy:<\/strong> Buy<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>New or used:<\/strong> Used<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Type of vehicle:<\/strong> Sedan<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Must haves:<\/strong> Reliable, safe, fuel efficient<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc):<\/strong> Automatic<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Intended use:<\/strong> Daily Driver<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered:<\/strong> Toyota Corolla, Toyota Camry, Toyota Pruis, Honda Civic, Honda Accord<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Is this your 1st vehicle:<\/strong> No, but first time buying on my own<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you need a Warranty:<\/strong> Preferred, would like CPO or anything equivalent<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> No<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> No<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Additional Notes:<\/strong> Aside from the research that I am currently doing, not very knowledgable about cars.

well.<\/p>\n<\/div>"},"comment_toplevel":{"0":1,"1":1,"2":1,"3":1,"4":1,"5":1,"6":1,"7":1,"8":1,"9":1,"10":1,"11":1,"12":1,"13":1,"14":1,"15":1,"16":1,"17":1,"18":1,"19":1,"20":1,"21":1,"22":1,"23":1,"24":1,"25":1,"26":1,"27":1,"28":1,"29":1,"30":1,"31":1,"32":1,"33":1,"34":1,"35":1,"36":1,"37":1,"38":1,"39":1,"40":1,"41":1,"42":1,"43":1,"44":1,"45":1,"46":1,"47":1,"48":1,"49":1,"50":1,"51":1,"52":1,"53":1,"54":1,"55":1,"56":1,"57":1,"58":1,"59":1,"60":1,"61":1,"62":1,"63":1,"64":1,"65":1,"66":1,"67":1,"68":1,"69":1,"70":1},"comment_distinguished":{"0":null,"1":null,"2":null,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null,"7":null,"8":null,"9":null,"10":null,"11":null,"12":null,"13":null,"14":null,"15":null,"16":null,"17":null,"18":null,"19":null,"20":null,"21":null,"22":null,"23":null,"24":null,"25":null,"26":null,"27":null,"28":null,"29":null,"30":null,"31":null,"32":null,"33":null,"34":null,"35":null,"36":null,"37":null,"38":null,"39":null,"40":null,"41":null,"42":null,"43":null,"44":null,"45":null,"46":null,"47":null,"48":null,"49":null,"50":null,"51":null,"52":null,"53":null,"54":null,"55":null,"56":null,"57":null,"58":null,"59":null,"60":null,"61":null,"62":null,"63":null,"64":null,"65":null,"66":null,"67":null,"68":null,"69":null,"70":null},"comment_edited":{"0":false,"1":false,"2":false,"3":false,"4":false,"5":false,"6":false,"7":false,"8":false,"9":false,"10":false,"11":false,"12":1607358587.0,"13":false,"14":false,"15":false,"16":false,"17":false,"18":false,"19":false,"20":false,"21":false,"22":false,"23":1607442377.0,"24":1607456943.0,"25":false,"26":1607448297.0,"27":false,"28":false,"29":false,"30":false,"31":false,"32":false,"33":false,"34":false,"35":false,"36":false,"37":false,"38":false,"39":false,"40":false,"41":false,"42":false,"43":false,"44":false,"45":false,"46":1607696464.0,"47":false,"48":false,"49":false,"50":false,"51":false,"52":false,"53":false,"54":false,"55":false,"56":false,"57":false,"58":false,"59":false,"60":false,"61":1607907285.0,"62":1607919549.0,"63":false,"64":false,"65":false,"66":1607374582.0,"67":false,"68":1607404486.0,"69":false,"70":1607349064.0},"comment_is_submitter":{"0":false,"1":false,"2":false,"3":false,"4":false,"5":false,"6":false,"7":false,"8":false,"9":false,"10":false,"11":false,"12":false,"13":false,"14":false,"15":false,"16":false,"17":false,"18":false,"19":false,"20":false,"21":false,"22":false,"23":false,"24":false,"25":false,"26":false,"27":false,"28":false,"29":false,"30":false,"31":false,"32":false,"33":false,"34":false,"35":false,"36":false,"37":false,"38":false,"39":false,"40":false,"41":false,"42":false,"43":false,"44":false,"45":false,"46":false,"47":false,"48":false,"49":false,"50":false,"51":false,"52":false,"53":false,"54":false,"55":false,"56":false,"57":false,"58":false,"59":false,"60":false,"61":false,"62":false,"63":false,"64":false,"65":false,"66":false,"67":false,"68":false,"69":false,"70":false},"comment_score":{"0":2,"1":2,"2":2,"3":2,"4":2,"5":2,"6":2,"7":2,"8":2,"9":2,"10":2,"11":1,"12":1,"13":1,"14":1,"15":1,"16":1,"17":1,"18":1,"19":1,"20":1,"21":1,"22":1,"23":1,"24":1,"25":1,"26":1,"27":1,"28":1,"29":1,"30":1,"31":1,"32":1,"33":1,"34":1,"35":1,"36":1,"37":1,"38":1,"39":1,"40":1,"41":1,"42":1,"43":1,"44":1,"45":1,"46":1,"47":1,"48":1,"49":1,"50":1,"51":1,"52":1,"53":1,"54":1,"55":1,"56":1,"57":1,"58":1,"59":1,"60":1,"61":1,"62":1,"63":1,"64":1,"65":1,"66":1,"67":1,"68":1,"69":1,"70":-1},"comment_stickied":{"0":false,"1":false,"2":false,"3":false,"4":false,"5":false,"6":false,"7":false,"8":false,"9":false,"10":false,"11":false,"12":false,"13":false,"14":false,"15":false,"16":false,"17":false,"18":false,"19":false,"20":false,"21":false,"22":false,"23":false,"24":false,"25":false,"26":false,"27":false,"28":false,"29":false,"30":false,"31":false,"32":false,"33":false,"34":false,"35":false,"36":false,"37":false,"38":false,"39":false,"40":false,"41":false,"42":false,"43":false,"44":false,"45":false,"46":false,"47":false,"48":false,"49":false,"50":false,"51":false,"52":false,"53":false,"54":false,"55":false,"56":false,"57":false,"58":false,"59":false,"60":false,"61":false,"62":false,"63":false,"64":false,"65":false,"66":false,"67":false,"68":false,"69":false,"70":false},"author_id":{"0":"","1":"g59y7","2":"8qy5h8fs","3":"7u3kl","4":"6qeoqbb8","5":"z2o1a","6":"98nhmx4i","7":"10yg79","8":"12jykj","9":"3ylatx6t","10":"11app1","11":"4clih","12":"v7jy3","13":"165vo4","14":"jqdae","15":"7myaw","16":"un9vd","17":"168u6m","18":"","19":"a1x44","20":"14zskp","21":"","22":"4gbpjgj8","23":"","24":"60tqn","25":"2lm4xpn9","26":"2mg1dg50","27":"7qwn3","28":"7n996","29":"7o948","30":"93ljygrs","31":"655bidgn","32":"6xe8rbr9","33":"5lmqi","34":"4d0yziyb","35":"rc00j","36":"h65dv0r","37":"3dzs2dbc","38":"45o1zfoi","39":"fd6o0","40":"mwalp","41":"18739js","42":"2volxmix","43":"xxcdl","44":"8mtqdfcs","45":"2z008fhq","46":"","47":"3dbuqm1h","48":"","49":"12smpu","50":"jglrrzn","51":"cdxq3","52":"","53":"3dy4xhyn","54":"132ysi","55":"","56":"4x2hb","57":"o9esm","58":
