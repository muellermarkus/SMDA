Then someone suggested a plug-in hybrid (I would like the option of doing occasional road trips with it, thus all electric won&#39;t work). I&#39;m thinking that with the $7500 tax credit, the cost of the car could be more manageable.

Should I sell my 2017 GTI SE to Carvana and use the money to purchase a used 2006 BMW M6? For whatever reason Carvana is offering me $4000 over what I have left on the loan. Returning the GTI back to stock and selling the aftermarket parts would net me an additional $2000 or so. The M6 has less than 45000 miles, never been in an accident, and has had regular maintenance done on it with service records as proof. Price of the M6 ranges from $18k-$23k (looking at two cars right now). Buying either M6 would result in either an equal or lower monthly.<\/p>\n\n<p>I love my GTI, it really is the whole package. It may not have the raw V10 engine noise, and sadly never will, or pull all the way to redline as ferociously as the M6 in top gear (only hearsay as I&#39;ve never personally driven one at those stupid speeds, only ridden passenger to somewhat sane lose-your-license speeds) but with a Stage 2 tune it is pretty damn fast, traction permitting. There&#39;s just something about the M6 that appeals to me.

Had an 06 GTO that I owned (which I miss dearly), that I pretty much rebuilt from the ground up. My commute to work is 45 minutes and the STI doesn\u2019t exactly make that ride pleasant. But its good in the snow, and snow can be an issue where I live. The three cars I listed are my main choices currently, I personally love the way the Chevy SS looks(despite what other people think), and the sound they make is awesome. Also, manual. The Audi is on another level when it comes to quality and comfort, I\u2019m in love with the interiors on the new Audi\u2019s and I think the virtual cockpit is the coolest thing ever.

More of an emotional decision.<\/p>\n\n<p>I currently own a 2016 Cayman GTS w\/manual. I&#39;ve owned it since new. Warranty ends in 4k miles or the end of November if I somehow don&#39;t put those miles on first. It&#39;s my weekend\/fun car, I have a steady DD and have no need for anything else with DD capabilities. I love driving my Cayman. I spend most of my time driving through the mountains with some highway use and occasional date night. 80% is spent in the mountains though. There&#39;s nothing &quot;wrong&quot; with it but I want a new experience. The dilemma I&#39;m facing is to trade in my Cayman or buy a second weekend car.<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>-Option 1: I keep the Cayman and buy: \n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>Ferrari 360 w\/manual<\/p>\n\n<p>06-08 Lamborghini Gallardo w\/manual<\/p>\n\n<p>C8 Corvette Z06 pending looks and manual transmission<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>-Option 2: I trade in the Cayman and buy:\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>991.2 GT3 w\/manual<\/p>\n\n<p>F430 Scuderia<\/p>\n\n<p>Lamborghini Gallardo LP550-2 w\/manual<\/p>\n\n<p>Ferrari 458<\/p>\n\n<p>Lamborghini Huracan<\/p>\n\n<p>Open to other options under $200k<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>-Option 3: I trade in the Cayman and buy:\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>718 GT4.

If there was no oil dilution problem, I&#39;d just go with it. I&#39;m looking for a car that will last me 10-15+ years, so the longevity concerns me. I used to have a corolla, but did not like it for lack of truck space.

I&#39;m 19, college student, pretty much completely independent. I have access to the advice of my father (and he will probably fix anything he can for me, which is many things) but not help in many other ways. Right now I drive a 2000 BMW 528i, got about 220,000 miles and really on her last leg. I want a station wagon. Heres where I&#39;ve gotten so far:<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Used to have a MB wagon as a kid, love the extra 2 seats in the back but I decided I don&#39;t want a luxury car this time. My dad is the type to only buy luxury cars, even if we can only afford a waaay old one, and luxury isn&#39;t even my style. I&#39;m a little more outdoorsy.<\/p>\n\n<p>I like the Outback but the years I can afford have a head gasket issue, so that&#39;s a no go.<\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve narrowed it down to these two: 2005ish Passat wagon and 2009-20014ish Jetta Sportwagen. All of the ones I&#39;m looking at have 88k-110k miles on them, approx, and cost approx. 5-7k. I&#39;m looking at the bigger capacity engines too.<\/p>\n\n<p>So I have to decide between getting the older Passat, which is obviously a nicer (and bigger) car. The extra storage space would be a huge plus. I also like the aesthetic (straight lines, hard corners) of the old station wagons of ever make better. However it is a much older car.<\/p>\n\n<p>Or I can get the newer Jetta Sportwagen, definitely a lower end car with less space. I also don&#39;t like the aesthetic of the new wagons as much. They look like a mini van and a sedan had a baby, they&#39;re all curvy and bubbly. Yuck. Hoever the ease of the tech in the car would be awesome (bluetooth, phone charging, etc etc driving a new car is just nice). And the gas mileage is probably better.<\/p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;<\/p>\n\n<p>Also thinking CRV or RAV4 but those are harder to find cheaper and I worry more about the gas mileage. Also less space in the back if I wanna sleep in there when camping. Let me know if there&#39;s something else you think of though<\/p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;<\/p>\n\n<p>Someone in that thread mentioned Japanese wagons.

I know the car will never see the track, unless i take it, so I suggested her the 911 turbo s or less expensive carerra GTS. We check it out and both test drove it. It was incredible and i felt the interior was plenty good. She disagreed and checked out the Mercedes AMG GTR and says the exterior, interior, and comfort is higher. I completely disagreed, saying the car is attention grabbing, a negative in my opinion, and less comfortable. We both test drove it and i feel it is definitely the worse daily driver. Anyways, today mercedes gave her an incredible deal on the GTR since its the end of the month at 172,000. Its about 13,000 under sticker. I convinced her to not buy it (shes paying cash) and to consider the 911 carerra GTS or cheaper carerra, because she wont be able to use the GTR\u2019s potential anyways... its just a fashion statement. <\/p>\n\n<p>Im confused as to why mercedes is willing to get rid of their GTR for 13,000 under sticker... my thought is there must be some underlying reason other than it being the end of the month.<\/p>\n\n<p>Its her decision of course, but ive been trying to convince her against the amg gtr for a few days now.
