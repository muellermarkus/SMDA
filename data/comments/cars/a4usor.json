I currently own a 1999 4runner, it\u2019s great, but high mileage, hard life, and a growing family has got me thinking it\u2019s time to upgrade. I won\u2019t be financing this vehicle and have got the wife to agree I can spend up to 50k. I work from home, and the only time this car will get driven is to the airport when I travel, or to go off-roading\/camping\/skiing that type of stuff. On average I drive about 4000 miles a year. \nI would love a new or newer Tacoma, but they 4doors don\u2019t leave much room for car seats, I would also love a new 4Runner, but I would prefer it had a v8, and that Toyota would update the interior of both the Tacoma and 4Runner a bit. The new tundra is expensive and too large for the off-roading we typically do. In the past I had a first gen tundra that I loved, but I\u2019m not sure the 4 door first gens have much room in the back seat either. All signs point to a land cruiser or LX, but I can\u2019t wrap my head around the cost associated with a vehicle with (typically) such high mileage, even with their reliability. \nOutside of Toyota about the only thing I have considered is a Raptor, not a big Ford fan though. I\u2019ve ruled out most trucks and SUV\u2019s based on their size and lack of offroad ability. I do 5-6 fairly serious off-road runs each year and numerous camping trips. I fully understand finding a dad car that can stand up to a fairly tough 4x4 Trail is a stretch, just hoping I can talk it through with someone else or if there is something I should consider that I haven\u2019t. <\/p>\n<\/div>","14":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: Utah, USA<\/p>\n\n<p>Price range: $15k-$22k used,<\/p>\n\n<p>Lease or Buy: Buy<\/p>\n\n<p>New or used: used<\/p>\n\n<p>Type of vehicle: Small SUV<\/p>\n\n<p>Must haves: 4x4 or AWD, Trunk space (room for cello or large breed dog), quiet ride (my current car, Subaru Forester, gets kinda loud on the freeway), full entertainment system<\/p>\n\n<p>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc): Auto<\/p>\n\n<p>Intended use: Daily Driving (my commute is 5 min).

I was in a fender bender last week that rendered my car (Toyota RAV4) undriveable, but I&#39;m moving within the next 8-10 months and will no longer need a car. The (trustworthy-according-to-Yelp) mechanic told me that it would likely cost more to repair my slightly smushed car than I could sell it for in a year. I have plenty of cash on hand, but I&#39;m not exactly rich, so I&#39;d like to try to break even.<\/p>\n\n<p>So my thinking is that I&#39;ll sell the RAV on Craigslist for parts, buy a fairly old used car for which the depreciation curve has flattened out, and resell the used car within a year, ideally for close to the same price.<\/p>\n\n<p>My questions:<\/p>\n\n<p>(1) Any ideas for used car make\/model\/year that will make it easier to resell? Part of me wants to go super-cheap (&lt;$1500) because if I have trouble reselling it, I can eat the loss; on the other hand, it seems like really crummy older cars might be harder to sell!<\/p>\n\n<p>(2) Any heuristics on how to complete the transaction in the way that&#39;s least likely to leave me screwed financially? I&#39;ve never bought any sort of car before, and I&#39;m considering Craigslist. I can certainly look at KBB\/Edmunds values and ask to have the car inspected by a mechanic before I buy. What should I be seeking other than that? Some kind of Carfax report, warranty, etc.? Would I be better off with a dealer?<\/p>\n\n<p>(3) Can you think of some other approach that would make more financial sense? I do want a car for the next several months; I feel a bit trapped otherwise.<\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m hoping to get some kind of vehicle relatively quickly ... is a week a reasonable timeline?<\/p>\n\n<p>Thank you for considering this problem.
