Also, as a student I make several trips a semester of 500 miles round trip from school back to my hometown, so fuel economy and comfort are now just as if not more important than being sporty. Basically, I need a slightly more grownup car that I can take my girlfriend and other professionals in that is not completely soul sucking and appliance like, being more comfortable and mature than my MS3 while still being able to hoon. PS, have experience with tuning, would still like a car I can tune. \nPSS, I kinda have a thing for diesels even if they&#39;re kinda slow. \nTHANKs<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>","42":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[gel\u00f6scht]<\/p>\n<\/div>","43":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[gel\u00f6scht]<\/p>\n<\/div>","44":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Non-CPO 2013 A7?<\/p>\n\n<p>Worth the risk?<\/p>\n<\/div>","45":"<div class=\"md\"><p>\u2022 Location: Washington state, USA<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Price: 20-27K <\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 New or used: New preferable or low mileage CPO<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Type of vehicle: Hatchback, Wagon, Crossover<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Must haves: Hatchback, not completely terrible fuel economy, CarPlay, reasonably fun to drive would be a bonus.

There&#39;s a sale going on until Monday that&#39;s 15% off MSRP up to $17,000 (Ontario)<\/p>\n\n<p>A few questions: I&#39;m coming from a mazda 6 (I&#39;m tired of getting stuck all winter) what considerations or differences in general, all purpose use is there between an AWD SUV and something like this with true 4x4? I won&#39;t be towing anything, I&#39;m mostly attracted to it because:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>a) most SUV\/crossovers look like tampons these days. They&#39;re very curvy and bland and not masculine. I miss the body styling of the 2010 Escape, or Rav4 with the tire on the back. Rugged. But still practical. <\/li>\n<li>b) I bought my mazda two kids ago. <\/li>\n<li>c) True 4WD makes me think I can finally enjoy a winter in my vehicle. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>So what is life like in a 4x4 Jeep GC vs. a regular AWD system in a typical bland crossover SUV? <\/p>\n\n<p>Secondly, I&#39;m nervous about overall reliability. I want to have something fairly easy to own for the next 10+ years. And jeep\/Dodge\/Chrystler doesn&#39;t have a strong reputation for that around here. I know most of that probably stems from a couple things: their entry level vehicles were pretty crappy, the Daimler Mercedes era destroyed a lot of brand credibility etc. The Grand Cherokee itself is rated quite highly by auto journalism which is comforting. <\/p>\n\n<p>Lastly, what are the back seats like? It&#39;ll have two front-facing car seats in it to lug some small humans around to and from school everyday. I&#39;m hoping they&#39;re at least as spacious as a mid-size car or more. <\/p>\n\n<p>Double lastly, the pentastar v6: enough? <\/p>\n\n<p>Anyway, any tips or info is greatly appreciated. <\/p>\n<\/div>","55":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Here&#39;s a fun one. <\/p>\n\n<p>2017 Civic Si<\/p>\n\n<p>Or keep my Mazda3 and buy an early NC Miata?<\/p>\n\n<p>If I go two car mode I&#39;d have to leave a car street parked.

I drive in a urban area over the weekend with mostly parallel parking, so looking for a car that&#39;s not as long as the Camry (it can be hard to find a spot long enough). I also sometimes move small furniture like small dining tables or patio chairs, which my current car can usually handle, but I&#39;d be concerned about in a smaller car, which is why I&#39;d prefer a hatch back. I&#39;d therefore also appreciate larger doorways so I can fit the furniture through the opening. Due my driving habits, I&#39;d appreciate high fuel efficiency. Being fun to drive would be a plus, but I think I&#39;m willing to sacrifice that for the other criteria. I&#39;d also appreciate a reliable car with low repair needs. So far, I&#39;m most seriously considering the Honda Fit\/Kia Soul\/Toyota Corolla iM. The Fit just looks like a very practical car without being completely boring, and it seems cargo space is pretty configurable. I&#39;d most likely spring for the EX version. The Kia Soul is a quirky looking car, and it seems like cargo space and back door width is great. Lastly, the iM is my &quot;irrational&quot; pick as it I just really like the look of the car, even though everything else seems pretty average. I can&#39;t seem to find stats for the cargo space with seats down. I do like the iM solely because of the Toyota name. Out of all cars in my family, Toyotas just seem to last longer and give us less trouble, though it&#39;s definitely possible that&#39;s just a coincidence. I&#39;m definitely open to other cars that fit this bill that I haven&#39;t thought of.

It still runs but its starting to make some not so pleasant noises that my mechanic and I cannot diagnose. It&#39;s also drinking oil at an alarming rate but has no leaks. I also used to have a 2003 Ford Thunderbird that would jump in way too often as a daily driver and I would drive spiritedly in Upstate NY on the weekends. I had to sell it because parts were becoming too scarce to do repairs and would cost me a boatload. My debate is do I get something that could pull double duty as a Daily Driver and Weekend Cruiser or do I try to hold onto the Explorer and purchase a Mustang GT for fun on the weekends and nice days.
