From the reviews I have read\/watched, it seems like the car still performs well compared to others in the same price range, but it falls somewhat flat in terms of daily amenities.<\/p>\n\n<p>Also worthy of note: I can drive standard, but have owned automatics all my life. If I buy something closer to an actual sports car (wrx\/civix SI), I am inclined to buy a standard, but I am hesitant because I enjoy the convenience of automatic when I&#39;m not in the mood to rip around.<\/p>\n\n<p>I know I have just vaguely described half the cars under $30k.

Our only other cars are a 2011 Jeep Wrangler Rubicon 4Dr (Dad Fun car), 2003 Toyota Sequoia(work\/haul car for property management work), my 2010 Camaro SS and our now dying 2001 VW Beetle. <\/p>\n\n<p>They work full-time (50mile round trip) at a resort-type company and do part-time property management work. The VW Beetle has been their primary way of cheaply getting to work (30+mpg) and it is on its last legs. The Sequoia is often a bit dusty or dirty so not used much as a daily driver and the 14mph Wrangler and 13mpg Camaro don&#39;t do much better. Fuel Economy isn&#39;t critical but it can&#39;t be overly poor either. We are in a good financial state right now where this isn&#39;t a major consideration but it can&#39;t be in the tens like we have above.<\/p>\n\n<p>They want a BMW or Mercedes as their primary choices and so we&#39;ve looked at the SLK 350 and 335i that I listed above. Japanese Luxury cars like Lexus are also a possibility. I&#39;ve warned them about daily driving these German cars and taking it to work as it could incur dings but they are going forward with this idea anyway.<\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not overly familiar with the types of increased costs that German cars will occur but do know that it is more expensive and less DIY friendly than typical Japanese\/American cars. Any insight or tips are appreciated.<\/p>\n\n<p>We also are not sure of what are the &#39;recommended&#39; model lines in our price range. Any other Mercedes or BMW you can recommend that are within our price range used? (and possibly easy on upkeep?) Having moderate to nice power would be a plus for my dad and I as well :)<\/p>\n<\/div>","10":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: <strong>Australia<\/strong> (but I&#39;ll put prices in USD so it&#39;s easier for you to assess)<\/p>\n\n<p>Price range: <strong>7600 USD -&gt; 20,000 USD<\/strong> ($10k AUD - &gt; $26k or a bit higher, AUD)<\/p>\n\n<p>Type of vehicle: <strong>sporty<\/strong> (coupe or convertible)<\/p>\n\n<p>Intended use: <strong>daily driver<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Age:<\/strong> Ideally not older than a decade (give\/take a couple years) <\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Vehicles I am considering:<\/p>\n\n<p>$15-19k USD for a Toyota GT 86<\/p>\n\n<p>$9-14k USD for a Mazda MX5 Miata NC<\/p>\n\n<p>$18-20k USD for a Porsche Boxster S (1999-2005)<\/p>\n\n<p>$7.6-11k USD for Volkswagen EOS convertible (2007-2012)<\/p>\n\n<p>$14-20k USD Nissan 370Z (2009) <\/p>\n\n<p>$11.5-14.5k USD Nissan 350z<\/p>\n\n<p>$11.5-18k USD BMW Z4 E85<\/p>\n\n<p>$11.5-18k USD Volkswagen Golf 118TSI <\/p>\n\n<p>Any others I should look out for? <\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m mainly tossing up between an MX5 and a GT86, but it&#39;s tough. <\/p>\n<\/div>","11":"<div class=\"md\"><p><strong>Location:<\/strong> Denver area<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Price Range:<\/strong> As cheap as possible; $0-$1500<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>New or used:<\/strong> Used<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Type of vehicle:<\/strong> Sedan or coupe.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Must haves:<\/strong> Manual, ability to take a beating, fairly easy to work on, fun given budget constraints (see additional notes)<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Intended use:<\/strong> Highway driving.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered:<\/strong> Ford ZX2, Saturn SL2 and SC2, Chevy Cavalier<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Is this your 1st vehicle:<\/strong> No<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Does the vehicle need to have a warranty:<\/strong> No<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> Yes<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> Yes, if it can be put off for up to a month.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Additional Notes:<\/strong> I honestly really enjoy driving my &#39;99 SL2.

She is open to CUV\/SUV however she does not want huge. She lives in NorCal so gas prices are ridiculous, and she won&#39;t be driving it much, but would like to have a car that she likes to drive. My mom is 5ft tall so she needs something that can adjust the seats so she can actually reach the steering wheel\/peddles. She doesn&#39;t drive manual and she doesn&#39;t drive fast. She&#39;s pretty vanilla. But she does like interesting cars!<\/p>\n\n<p>I did get one response when I posted this in the thread from last week, and it said Forester or Outback.

Love the comfort of the car, but would like something a bit modern, quicker and quieter. I&#39;d like car to ideally have both traffic safety features and carplay\/android auto. The killer feature would be adaptive cruise control that works in stop and go traffic, lane keeping and the airplay feature. Seems like I can choose either the driver assistance package or the usable LCD screen - hard to find  both in the budget. An alternative is to put another ~$1500 in my Volvo to make it go another year until more tech is available.<\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve investigated VW GTI, the current leader. Also considering used luxury cars like a S60 that have depreciated that would have some of the driver assistance tech. If going used I&#39;d like to spend in the 20-25K region vs. the 30-35K region for a new car.
