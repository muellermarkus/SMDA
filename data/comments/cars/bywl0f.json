We hadn\u2019t been considering anything in the \u201cluxury\u201d SUV class due to the higher sticker price, but Buick is trying to move these things (still suffers the old white mans car label), and the prices have dropped down into the 28k range on dealer websites, which gets it right next to the VW in price. We like the Tiguan because of the third row seating, but they seem to otherwise have many overlapping similar features. I was surprised to read Buick\u2019s are considered highly reliable, but that is also a big plus. Other than a higher initial sticker price, is there that much of a difference between these two that I\u2019m missing? Anything I should know about either vehicle that isn\u2019t common knowledge?

I am a 20 year old and I got a speeding ticket 2 years ago and was in an accident 20 months ago. Since then I have not owned my own car because $400+ per month for insurance is just ludicrous and I don&#39;t even know if getting a car is worth it with such high insurance.<\/p>\n<\/div>","12":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[gel\u00f6scht]<\/p>\n<\/div>","13":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Question: Can you buy 2016-2018 cars new? like do they stop selling 2016-2018 cars?

I got really excited about the CX-5 until I drove it today... It just felt a bit &quot;stiff&quot; (and sorry of that&#39;s not the right word but English is not my first language). The wheel felt a lot less smoother than my Fit and the HRV. But I might test drive it again just to make sure it was not a bad first impression. The HRV didn&#39;t get me super excited because it still looks a lot like my Fit and I just wanted something a bit different. The Crosstrek just felt a bit ugly on the inside (and the outside) and honestly didn&#39;t get me excited, but since my husband is getting a Subaru we might me able 5o get a better deal buying two cars at the same place. I like the Tucson and owned one in Brazil, but didn&#39;t test drive it here so I might have to check it out. And the Rogue didn&#39;t stand out as well. Should I consider something else?
