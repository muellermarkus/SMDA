Everyone says don&#39;t make the big mistake of buying a crazy car at 20... The way I see it.. I&#39;m only 20 once, and having a nice car at this age is cooler than having one when I&#39;m older. And if 2020 has showed us anything it&#39;s how life is unexpected and tomorrow isn&#39;t guaranteed. So although it may not be the smartest financially. I&#39;d like to have a fun car for while i&#39;m still young, and I think I&#39;ll still turn out alright with my financial situation.<\/p>\n<\/div>","14":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: Around Raleigh, NC<\/p>\n\n<p>Price Range: &lt;$75k<\/p>\n\n<p>Lease or Buy: Buy unless amazing lease deal<\/p>\n\n<p>New or used: New preferred<\/p>\n\n<p>Type of vehicle: Muscle or Sports<\/p>\n\n<p>Must haves: Some trunk space for a bag or two, groceries, decent head space, power\/quick launch speed, and nice engine\/exhaust noise.<\/p>\n\n<p>Desired transmission: Auto<\/p>\n\n<p>Intended use: Daily Driver, cruise around in, go places. - Only car<\/p>\n\n<p>Vehicles you\u2019ve already considered: Challenger Hellcat Widebody, TT RS<\/p>\n\n<p>Is this your 1st vehicle: No<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle: Some, but would rather not.<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle: No.<\/p>\n\n<p>Loved muscle cars since I was a kid, so I&#39;m a bit attached to the idea of the hellcat and I love the look of the widebody.

Kind of a drag that it&#39;s automatic only, but I could probably get over that. Cost of tires are cheaper than the mustang lol.<\/p>\n\n<p>BMW M4. Looks nice, manual available. My biggest gripe is that it&#39;s more expensive than my mustang GT for virtually the same power.<\/p>\n\n<p>BMW M2. The more fun BMW I&#39;m told. Have not driven one. Depreciation of the M2 comp scares me off.<\/p>\n\n<p>Toyota Supra. Love this car! But it&#39;s just 1 pedal and a stick short of greatness. Dare I say I might even buy new if Toyota throws a manual in it, which I know I would lose money on that.<\/p>\n\n<p>C7 Corvette. Drives great, checks all the boxes.

I\u2019m currently looking into 2 vehicles extensively, Dodge challenger R\/T and a Cadillac CTS4 Coupe, both 2011. The dodge has been my dream for years, my favorite car since it\u2019s release has been the Demon, and I\u2019ve liked american muscle since I was a young kid. However, I used to be able to find reasonable deals on these cars for 12 or 13k, but Ive found none during these times.  The Challenger i\u2019ve got my eyes set on has only 42k miles, which is a really nice upside, and it appears to be very well maintained. It\u2019s had the Timing chain recall done based on the carfax, and has had no accidents and looks overall clean. The problem is, i\u2019m 17 and the car is 15k, but with dealer fees and taxes and such, will end up around 17k. I\u2019ve been saving and have another job lined up, and with my high school graduation coming up people in my family are willing to help me out and give me that nice 0% interest loan. Even still, it\u2019s much more than my desired max budget. The Cadillac is a nice alternative. $10,900, and it\u2019s a private seller, and the cars been up a hot minute with no price drops meaning I can likely work him down to 10,500 or 10 even possibly. The car also appears to be in pretty great condition, though with over double the miles of the dodge at 95k. All wheel drive, so I can drive my enthusiast car year round is a bonus. Have always liked the CTS V in all its styles, and was completely unaware of this cars existence until recently. It makes much less power than the dodge, 300 horses out of a V6, but it\u2019s plenty upgrade for me, and in the future I might sell it and buy a Challenger anyway. A cold air intake and exhaust with a tune would be enough to give it a little more push in the near 4,000 pound body. It would be a lot more reasonable for me to afford and pay back, and would be a lot less stressful in general, though I don\u2019t wanna fall into the trap of settling and regretting it. I\u2019m also open for other suggestions. And any extra information on the CTS would be nice too if anyone has any to offer, especially on reliability since I can find so little information on it.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<\/div>","33":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Not buying so not following the format, please don\u2019t delete.

Active lifestyle with lots of outdoor activities. Big guy so having space is important.<\/p>\n\n<p>Interior cabin space is extremely important to me as driving small cramped cars aggravates my injuries a lot. Especially seats\/setups that squeeze my shoulders forward and limit how much i can open my legs. <\/p>\n\n<p>I test drove the Kia Seltos, Kia Sportage, and Chevrolet Trailblazer. I actually like the Trailblazer a lot. Had a real chevy feel to it, like a small camaro. The only drawback was the lack of shoulder room, and the fact you can get more for the same price with the Kia Seltos.   <\/p>\n\n<p>Seltos was fun too but had the same drawback as the Chevy, lack of shoulder room. <\/p>\n\n<p>The Sportage EX I drove just for comparison sake, but I feel like the interior had everything I wanted. More hip room and shoulder room. BUT THEN WHY LESS HEAD ROOM? I have big hair so the headroom helps a lot.  <\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m so close to pulling the trigger on the 2021 Kia Sportage EX but I cant get over how ugly the exterior looks. My heart sinks every time I look at it. It looks like it got in an accident and the doctors &quot;did their best&quot;  <\/p>\n\n<p>But I love everything else about the car. I&#39;m willing to ignore the exterior and just enjoy what the car offers for the duration of my 3 year lease I guess. <\/p>\n\n<p>Also, for some reason, insurances are quoting me a higher premium for the cheaper subcompact suvs, but is charging me less for the sportage? Why?<\/p>\n<\/div>","92":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: US, Colorado<\/p>\n\n<p>Price range: Flexible<\/p>\n\n<p>Lease or Buy: Buy<\/p>\n\n<p>New or used: New<\/p>\n\n<p>Type of vehicle: SUV or Van<\/p>\n\n<p>Must haves: 4x4 or AWD, Fuel efficient, V8 or V6, Towing capabilities, ability to carry roof top tent<\/p>\n\n<p>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc): Manual<\/p>\n\n<p>Intended use: Daily Driver<\/p>\n\n<p>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: Subaru Crosstrek, Ford Bronco, Ram Promaster\/Promaster City, Jeep Wrangler<\/p>\n\n<p>Is this your 1st vehicle: No, currently driving 2007 Dodge Ram 1500<\/p>\n\n<p>Do you need a Warranty: Yes<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle: Yes<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle: No<\/p>\n<\/div>","93":"<div class=\"md\"><p><strong>Location:<\/strong> USA, Southern California<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Price range:<\/strong> 0-5K USD<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Lease or Buy:<\/strong> Buy<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>New or used:<\/strong> Used<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Type of vehicle:<\/strong> Car<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Must haves:<\/strong> Decent fuel efficiency and decent interior\/trunk space - nothing fancy but nothing I&#39;d hate using for daily commutes and weekend trips<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc):<\/strong> Auto, I&#39;m one of those Gen Zs who can&#39;t drive manual (yet!)<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Intended use:<\/strong> Commuter\/daily driver<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered:<\/strong> Not much?

I have never owned one before. I am taking my driving test on Wednesday. I would want an opinion to decide on one of the 2 used cars I have narrowed my search to. I shall use it for general use. I work remotely as of now, but I might have to shift to San Francisco in August, where I plan to use this car for the work commute. I would go for occasional hikes outside the city and travel, usually once a month.<\/p>\n\n<p>Features important to me are great looks, safety features, <strong>efficiency in terms of longevity<\/strong>, how often does it need maintenance, performance, and cost of repairs.<\/p>\n\n<p>Both Ford Fusion Hybrid 2019 and Nissan Versa 2020 are within my budget. I am getting Nissan at about $1000 cheaper. Both have been used for 36,000 miles.<\/p>\n\n<p>My own assessments after the test drive: Ford Fusion Hybrid is just vastly superior in looks, both interior and exterior. It just looks richer and modern. However, the pick up (acceleration) from the Hybrid Engine is very slow, so that might not be a good thing while driving on Freeways and highways? Versa&#39;s is not that great either, but much better than Ford&#39;s. And a slightly bigger trunk too. Both are Certified Pre Owned, Ford was fleet use, Nissan was private use.<\/p>\n\n<p>Please weigh in your opinions, if you have driven either or both of these before.
