Personally I would prefer an electric or hybrid car. I do not require speed, &#39;feel to drive&#39; neither do I require long range. Currently the Government is giving grants to people buying electric cars of 8,000 Euro. Due to this fact, some electric cars which would be out of reach now seem to be more affordable.<\/p>\n\n<p>I care mostly on efficient, reliability and running cost. I&#39;m looking at Toyota Yaris Hybrid and Nissan Leaf (Electric). I tried asking the local Honda and Ford agency regarding electric and hybrid, yet magically they do not know that they even do non combustion engine cars. Tesla Model 3 is very attractive if I add the government grant, however being from Malta, I doubt I can find anywhere I can service the car.<\/p>\n\n<p>I wish to hear some suggestions from car car enthusiast. Are Electric\/Hybrid worth investing in? Are they the future? Do you have any other suggestions?  <\/p>\n<\/div>","90":"<div class=\"md\"><ul>\n<li>Location: MN, USA<\/li>\n<li>Price range: $2000-5000<\/li>\n<li>New or Used:used<\/li>\n<li>Type of vehicle : Smallish pickup truck <\/li>\n<li>Must haves: Heat ,AC, 2 doors <\/li>\n<li>Desired transmission: auto<\/li>\n<li>Intended use: daily driver and truck things<\/li>\n<li>Vehicles i&#39;ve already considered: Ford ranger <\/li>\n<li>Is this your first vehicle: Yes<\/li>\n<li>Does the vehicle need to have a warranty: No<\/li>\n<li>Can you do minor work on your own : yes<\/li>\n<li>Can you do major work on your own vehicle: no<\/li>\n<li>Additional notes: <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>","91":"<div class=\"md\"><ul>\n<li>Location: Ft Riley Kansas<\/li>\n<li>Price range: lease no higher then $250-300$<\/li>\n<li>New or Used: 2015-2017<\/li>\n<li>Type of vehicle: truck or a fast hatchback, like a Golf GTI type car <\/li>\n<li>Must haves: best on insurance, good stereo system, good amount of HP, good warranty, military rebates<\/li>\n<li>Desired transmission: automatic <\/li>\n<li>Intended use: go to work everyday<\/li>\n<li>Vehicles i&#39;ve already considered: Ford F150, Chevy Silverado, Toyota Tacoma, Golf GTI,  Audi A3<\/li>\n<li>Is this your first vehicle: No<\/li>\n<li>Does the vehicle need to have a warranty: Yes<\/li>\n<li>Can you do minor work on your own?: I could learn<\/li>\n<li>Can you do major work on your own vehicle: no<\/li>\n<li>Additional notes: <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>","92":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: East Texas<\/p>\n\n<p>Price Range: preferably less than $20,000<\/p>\n\n<p>Used<\/p>\n\n<p>Type of Vehicle: any<\/p>\n\n<p>Must haves: ability to carry four people, preferably decent storage space, fun to drive, not underpowered<\/p>\n\n<p>Transmission: Either. <\/p>\n\n<p>Intended Use: College vehicle.
