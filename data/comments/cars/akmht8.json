class=\"md\"><p>I feel like I am finally in a point in my life where I can afford my childhood dream of a Viper. I had a motorcycle in college I paid $5,000 for that got stolen. Insurance paid out $13,000 for the stolen motorcycle. I purchased my Camaro with cash for $16,000 and have driven it for the last 5 years. The previous owner recently contacted me and said he would buy it back for $15,000 (only $1,000 depreciation for me using it 5 years... I think that is fair).<\/p>\n\n<p>So I am looking into Vipers and see they are about $80,000. I have a $90,000 salary and my wife makes $70,000. We owe $135,000 on our house and we don&#39;t have any student debt or kids. My wife&#39;s car is paid off. I have $50,000 in a savings account.<\/p>\n\n<p>I was thinking about selling the Camaro for $15,000, adding an additional ~$15,000 for a $30,000 down payment and financing about $50,000. Insurance and maintenance seems to be pretty reasonable on these cars. I am thinking if I don&#39;t get my childhood dream car now, then I certainly won&#39;t get it when kids come.<\/p>\n\n<p>Do you think I am pushing it financially for the Viper?<\/p>\n<\/div>","1":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Hi! Obligatory &quot;not a car guy but...&quot;<\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve been trying to drive my &#39;05 Corolla into the dirt but it&#39;s unkillable, and it&#39;s time for an upgrade.<\/p>\n\n<p>Location: USA mountains<\/p>\n\n<p>Price range: &lt;18,000<\/p>\n\n<p>Lease or Buy:Buy<\/p>\n\n<p>New or used: Used<\/p>\n\n<p>Type of vehicle: Hatchback<\/p>\n\n<p>Must haves: Fuel efficient, high altitude power, good handling around curves, comfortable<\/p>\n\n<p>Desired transmission: manual<\/p>\n\n<p>Intended use: Daily commuter<\/p>\n\n<p>I commute 250 miles per week through winding mountain passes. The commute ranges from 6400 ft above sea level to over 9100.\nI have a dog and want a compact hatch. I have a truck I&#39;m happy with for the days I&#39;m concerned about bad weather or needing more space.<\/p>\n\n<p>I want to be able to pass forestry and utility trucks on these high winding passes. But I don&#39;t want to get killed by gasoline costs.<\/p>\n\n<p>I am torn between a Mazda3 2.5L, that I can get by using 86 octane gas versus a turbo hatch that will require high octane but will likely perform exceptionally better at these altitudes (Probably a WRX, but I&#39;ve looked at the Focus ST\/RS as well as the Golf R). The Civic hatch is just too godawful ugly to consider.<\/p>\n\n<p>So Mazda 3 2.5L vs WRX are the two I&#39;m most drawn to. I mean, really, as they say, if that 2.5L loses 3% power every 1000ft above sea level, am I truly dealing with an 18-27% drop in power with the Mazda 3? I guess that means that to maintain decent performance in these hills I need to pony up for 91+ octane gas.<\/p>\n\n<p>Thanks for your thoughts.<\/p>\n\n<p>Edit: welcome to the department of redundancy department<\/p>\n\n<p>Also am very open to buying a turbo diesel golf or other diesel turbo.<\/p>\n<\/div>","2":"<div class=\"md\"><ul>\n<li><strong>Location:<\/strong> New York, USA<\/li>\n<li><strong>Price range:<\/strong> $60-80k<\/li>\n<li><strong>Lease or Buy:<\/strong> Lease<\/li>\n<li><strong>New or used:<\/strong> New<\/li>\n<li><strong>Type of vehicle:<\/strong> Sedan<\/li>\n<li><strong>Must haves:<\/strong> AWD, V6, Leather, Apple\/Google Play (both pref, if not just Apple), Good Cameras (Excellent if possible)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Desired transmission:<\/strong> Auto<\/li>\n<li><strong>Intended use:<\/strong> Daily Driver<\/li>\n<li><strong>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered:<\/strong> Audi A5 Convertible, Cadillac CT6, Lexus LS500<\/li>\n<li><strong>Is this your 1st vehicle:<\/strong> No<\/li>\n<li><strong>Do you need a Warranty:<\/strong> No<\/li>\n<li><strong>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> No<\/li>\n<li><strong>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> No<\/li>\n<li><strong>Additional Notes:<\/strong> Something to consider: The Porsche Cayenne SUV isn&#39;t very nice for the price, the cameras aren&#39;t very good and the interface seems like a cockpit (although we are not looking for a SUV).

Price is a little restricted unfortunately because I only work casually at two jobs and I am about to start my second year of a four year uni degree and still live at home with no real intention of moving out until my degree has finished, so at the earliest moving out would probably be in 2022. Currently the biggest decision I am try to make is if it is worth it to sell a perfectly good car and then spend a few more thousand Dollars just for a car that would be used for essentially the same thing plus a small amount of irregular track use (would be mostly for a fun day with mates and to learn more so than anything near serious.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Ideally would like this car to last me a long time and I don&#39;t plan on selling it assuming I buy the right car for me.

I&#39;m looking at the XR4 because from all accounts it&#39;s cheap enough to run and it handles well, as you&#39;d expect from an ST. The competition I&#39;ve found was the Mitsubishi colt ralliart and Volkswagen polo gti; the colt got mixed reviews with reports of average handling and the turbo doesn&#39;t sound like fun on only a 110kw engine, and the polo runs in premium unleaded so it would be too expensive to run on a tight budget. I haven&#39;t found many things similar other than this. I did look to branch out a bit with a late 90s celica or an integra, but there were only lower models available and for the celica that meant not only was it described as a two door Camry but it also doesn&#39;t have ABS.  <\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve put what I think is a fair bit of research into the XR4: It claims 7.4l\/100km, some drivers have gotten 7.8 easily while others have been in the 8s, depending on how you drive it; there aren&#39;t any common or major reliability issues other than &quot;questionable gearbox reliability&quot;; it should cost 5-8k; and the side mirrors click 6-8 times when they fold inwards after you lock the car.  <\/p>\n\n<p>I know people love playing with these in the UK but I was planning on buying an untouched one and not modifying it.

Somewhere between the two, there&#39;s the RC-F, with greater practicality than the LC500, but less than the RS5 (no 40\/20\/40 split for rear passenger seats and no AWD).  <\/p>\n\n<p>Looking for a car that would make me excited to hop into the driver seat every time, usable enough on a daily basis, and won&#39;t break the bank with maintenance and repairs.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<\/div>","108":"<div class=\"md\"><p>&#x200B;<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Location:<\/strong> Los Angeles, CA  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Price range:<\/strong> $15,000 USD or less  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Lease or Buy:<\/strong> Buy  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>New or used:<\/strong> Used, let&#39;s be real  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Type of vehicle:<\/strong> Wagon or hatchback, could be talked into a sedan  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Must haves:<\/strong> ~30 MPG combined, fun to drive, under 60k miles (i.e. needs to last me 8 years at 18k a year)  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc):<\/strong> Either, but prefer auto  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Intended use:<\/strong> Daily driver  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered:<\/strong> Golf Sportwagen, Mini Clubman S, Mazda 3 i  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Is this your 1st vehicle:<\/strong> Nope  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you need a Warranty:<\/strong> No, but it&#39;d be nice  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> Yep!  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> No, sadly<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<\/div>","109":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: Toronto, Ontario, Canada<\/p>\n\n<p>Price range: 5K CAD <\/p>\n\n<p>Lease or Buy: Buy<\/p>\n\n<p>New or used: Used<\/p>\n\n<p>Type of vehicle: Coupe, Sedan, Hatchback, I&#39;m down for most cars<\/p>\n\n<p>Must haves: Manual, AWD or RWD, but will consider FWD, decent on gas, not the most boring thing to drive. 2003 or newer<\/p>\n\n<p>Desired transmission: Manual<\/p>\n\n<p>Intended use: Daily Driver<\/p>\n\n<p>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: Honda Civic, Subaru Impreza, Ford Fiesta, Audi A4, any BMW (will be high KM), <\/p>\n\n<p>Is this your 1st vehicle: No<\/p>\n\n<p>Do you need a Warranty: No<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle: Yes<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle: Yes<\/p>\n\n<p>Additional Notes:<\/p>\n<\/div>","110":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Location:<\/strong> Sydney Australia  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Price range:<\/strong> Max 5k AUD  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Type of vehicle:<\/strong> Preferably coupe otherwise hatch\/sedan  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Must haves:<\/strong> P plate approved (NSW), max 200km, decent interior, Manual  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Intended use:<\/strong> First car, general driving to school and sports training  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered:<\/strong> Kia Cerato Coupe, Hyundai i20, Holden Barina, Mazda 3  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Is this your 1st vehicle:<\/strong> Yes  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> If its cheap  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> Nah<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<\/div>","111":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: sacramento, ca<\/p>\n\n<p>Price range: $4k-$6k<\/p>\n\n<p>Lease or Buy: lease<\/p>\n\n<p>New or used:used<\/p>\n\n<p>Type of vehicle: car<\/p>\n\n<p>Must haves: <\/p>\n\n<p>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc): auto<\/p>\n\n<p>Intended use: Daily Driver<\/p>\n\n<p>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: nissan, heard transmission is a huge problem so I \ndecided not to get it.
