I want something that is fun to drive and has a little more power than my current base model 07 Civic. I\u2019ve looked at a lot of my options already, just need some advice. <\/p>\n\n<p>I like the Eclipse GT but I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s unreliable and it doesn\u2019t have a large aftermarket (which I may or may not want to explore at some point), not to mention it doesn\u2019t have great gas mileage. Doesn\u2019t help that it only takes premium gas, either.<\/p>\n\n<p>The Cobalt SS Turbos are a bit more pricey but have the best \u201cbang for your buck\u201d according to most of the research I\u2019ve done. 5.5s 0-60 for that take off thrill I\u2019m desperately seeking. Problem is, I\u2019ve read they fall apart and most of the ones I\u2019ve seen are modded to hell (Idk if this makes it better or worse). Great gas mileage though. Curious if they\u2019re really that bad; I\u2019ve read conflicting reports.<\/p>\n\n<p>The Civic Si is probably similar to what I\u2019m used to, save for the extra horsepower. Great reliability and gas mileage, minor issues with 3rd gear synchro. Huge aftermarket. My main issue is that with only around 200hp, I keep hearing how much slower they are than literally anything else on the road unless you invest in aftermarket turbos. Speed isn\u2019t the end-all-be-all but I don\u2019t want to spend the same amount of money for less horsepower, and be forced to buy a turbo kit for the same price as the car itself. Would this be viable or a good long-term option? Are there other fast reliable options?<\/p>\n\n<p>Looked at NSX Type S, I like the modded style but like the Si, doesn\u2019t really seem to have the same power as some of the other options. On the other end of the spectrum, the Nissan 350z has all the power and none of the reliability. Insurance and gas prices would be awful, too.<\/p>\n\n<p>Overall I\u2019m looking for the thrill of pushing my petal down and being pushed back into my seat for an inexpensive price (I am on a college student budget). I\u2019ve always loved driving and it\u2019s become my passion. I\u2019m developing an interest in cars and modifications, and this is likely my first chance to dip my toes into the world of performance mods. I want a car I can rely on, but also one that\u2019s an absolute joy and blast to drive.<\/p>\n\n<p>Any advice is appreciated.<\/p>\n<\/div>","13":"<div class=\"md\"><p><strong>Location:<\/strong> Northern Ireland<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Price range:<\/strong> \u00a34000 - \u00a36000 (could obviously spend less, and could maybe stretch to \u00a37000)<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Lease or Buy:<\/strong> Buy<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>New or used:<\/strong> Used<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Type of vehicle:<\/strong> Hatchback or coupe<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Must haves:<\/strong> Low insurance group, touchscreen &amp; bluetooth would be nice but not necessary.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc):<\/strong> Manual<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Intended use:<\/strong> Daily driver<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered:<\/strong> VW Polo\/Golf, Seat Ibiza\/Leon, Ford Fiesta.

I currently have a 1998 4runner that I have beaten into the ground as my commuter, offroader, truck, campervan, dog hauler, etc for the last two years and $50k miles. It&#39;s to the point that it&#39;s not safe to drive anymore, so my plan is to turn it into a trail rig so I don&#39;t have to offroad my daily driver. I initially wanted a new 4runner, but the price is really off-putting, even on 4 yr old 79k mile vehicles, and I realized it would be too stressful to offroad a $30-40k car i&#39;m making payments on. I&#39;ve lived kind of a wild life and used to flip cars for fun, but I just turned 41 and I want a clean, quiet, reliable car that&#39;s enjoyable to drive. I spend a lot of time in my car, and I love driving, so it would be ideal if it was really fun to drive, i.e. good handling and performance. I take my dog with me literally everywhere (to work everyday, etc), so there has to be enough room for her and the other dog I might get eventually. Bike theft off of car racks is a serious problem here, so I&#39;d love it if I could fit my bike inside the car\/truck\/whatever.

Long version here: I own an &#39;07 Trailblazer with a 4.2 I6 which I love dearly. My wife however is starting to say that we need to look elsewhere for a more reliable vehicle. She doesn&#39;t feel safe in it. I recently had an issue with the gear shift linkage\/bushing which i replaced with an auto zone Dorman part rather than the entire shift linkage cable (no issues since). I then kept seeing a check engine code P1400 which I solved by removing the throttle body and cleaning it off with the appropriate sensor safe cleaner. <\/p>\n\n<p>Since that time I&#39;ve popped another P0128 code which is telling me i need to replace the thermostat, but to do that, all the youtube videos are showing that I&#39;ll need to remove the alternator which I&#39;m a bit hesitant to do since its a first time thing for me.<\/p>\n\n<p>______________<\/p>\n\n<p>I recently had a Virginia state inspection at a Firestone in the area which told me I needed about 1700 dollars worth of work before they would cut me a sticker. Took it elsewhere and was given an inspection sticker with little fuss. Replaced rear end brakes and rotors with the guy cause they were due and i was afraid to mess with them on my own. Wanted to establish a good relationship.<\/p>\n\n<p>Ive recently replaced the rack and pinion for the front end power steering (within 18 months), but the Firestone told me I have issues with my front end as well. The billing statement recommended lower control arm bracket bushings along with a new loaded strut assembly. I can&#39;t diagnose any issues when I drive day to day. Seems fine to me.<\/p>\n\n<p>My wife and I have saved up about 20k for an emergency but I&#39;ve been starting to look around at different vehicles. Only problem is that I like the cool stuff. I like SUV&#39;s with a little zip but would like a truck as well. I don&#39;t care about any modern amenities as I don&#39;t really see the need when I have my phone. I can live with basics and would almost prefer that to reduce costs. GPS, bluetooth, heated\/cooled seats are all unnecessary. If i can get a radio, A\/C and heat that would be great. Things I&#39;ve been starting to look at are older trucks such as the 1990 Chevy Silverado 1500 and a vehicle my buddy from Texas owns, a 1980 GMC Sierra Grande. Would prefer lower miles and something I can do a little work on myself.<\/p>\n\n<p>Any recommendations and help will be greatly appreciated to keep my wife happy\/safe and more confident in my daily driver....Dodge Hellcat SRT recommendations will also be passed along to her as they come ;)<\/p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;<\/p>\n\n<p>Thanks all and looking forward to the responses.<\/p>\n\n<p>~~Diggler<\/p>\n<\/div>","53":"<div class=\"md\"><p><strong>Location:<\/strong> Malaysia<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Price range:<\/strong> 10k USD <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Lease or Buy:<\/strong> Buy<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>New or used:<\/strong> doesn&#39;t matter<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Type of vehicle:<\/strong> sedan or hatch (up to C-seg)<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Must haves:<\/strong> good fuel economy, decent performance<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc):<\/strong> auto  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Intended use:<\/strong> daily driving\/highway cruising<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered:<\/strong> Eh...... a Picanto?<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Is this your 1st vehicle:<\/strong> no<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you need a Warranty:<\/strong> Probably<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> No<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> No<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Additional Notes:<\/strong> At this point my best choice is a used JDM such as Suzuki Swift or Honda Civic, but my parents suggest local cars.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<\/div>","54":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[gel\u00f6scht]<\/p>\n<\/div>","55":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Location:<\/strong>Austria, Carinthia  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Price range:<\/strong> around 10k  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Lease or Buy: Buy<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>New or used: Used<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Type of vehicle:<\/strong> Sporty Daily Driver  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Must haves:<\/strong> Fun Driving Experience, Low Maintenance Costs  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc): Manual preferred<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Intended use:<\/strong> Daily Driver  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: VW Scirocco, BMW 3-series<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Is this your 1st vehicle: No<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you need a Warranty: Yes<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> Yes  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> Yep  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Additional Notes:<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p>In Austria it&#39;s quite hard to find a good car for a low price, because we have a things, that&#39;s called NoVa, which rises the price of cars overall quite a lot  <\/p>\n\n<p>e.g.: A scirocoo 1.4 tfsi with standard trim on 70k km will cost you around 10k  <\/p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance, i truly love <a href=\"\/r\/cars\">r\/cars<\/a> for all the info you can get!<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<\/div>","56":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Location:<\/strong> Toronto Canada  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Price range:<\/strong> 25K-38K CAD  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Lease or Buy: Buy<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>New or used: Used<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Type of vehicle:<\/strong> SUV  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Must haves:<\/strong>  AWD, Navigation, Decent space, Fuel efficient  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Desired transmission: Auto<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Intended use:<\/strong> Daily Driver  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: 2017-2018 BMW X1, 2020 Volvo XC40 (But couldnt lease and out of price range to buy new)<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Is this your 1st vehicle: Yes<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you need a Warranty: No<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> Yes  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> No  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Additional Notes: Would like a car where the resale value wont drop too much after 3-4 years.

I know the car I really want is a used S3 or S4 from around 2016 for the right price but I&#39;m terrified of spending like 5K USD any time anything goes wrong and being that it would probably have around 40-60k miles on it that might be the case. My #2 is waiting a year or two until the 2019 G70 is possible to get bought for that price range. Or getting the 2015 Hyundai Genesis 5.0.<\/p>\n<\/div>","65":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Disclaimer: This is pure 100% bullshit, fantasy,  thank you for indulging me.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Location:<\/strong> (Specify your country or region) Midwest USA, Buffalo NY<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Price range:<\/strong> (Minimum-Maximum in your local currency) Doesn&#39;t matter, fantasy car<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Lease or Buy:<\/strong> Doesn&#39;t matter, fantasy car<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>New or used:<\/strong> Doesn&#39;t matter, fantasy car<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Type of vehicle:<\/strong> sports car, GT, coupe and\/or convertible<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Must haves:<\/strong> fully electric (or otherwise very quiet), smooth ride, precision handling<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc):<\/strong> ..............automatic<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Intended use:<\/strong> Weekend car, bonus if it can function as a daily<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered:<\/strong> Tesla Roaster, Tesla Model S<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Is this your 1st vehicle:<\/strong> No<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you need a Warranty:<\/strong> No<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> (fluids, alternator, battery, brake pads etc) yes<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> (engine and transmission, timing belt\/chains, body work, suspension etc ) No<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Additional Notes:<\/strong> I was kind of thinking, the Love child of a Miata and Tesla might be my sweet spot, but I don&#39;t know how compatible that would be.
