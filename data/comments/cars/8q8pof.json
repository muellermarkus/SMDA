This will just be a nice to have type of upgrade. Since the 2018 Model Year is a new redesign of the Accord it got thinking about what differences in features could possibly happen between Model Years?<\/p>\n\n<p>The only thing I have found from my research is that some features from higher tier trims will trickle down to lower tiers. However, since I am planning on buying the touring trim which is Honda&#39;s highest end trim for an Accord what features could possibly change in between Model Years?<\/p>\n\n<p>Would it just be under the cover part changes for quality issues?<\/p>\n\n<p>Would there be any actual changes to visible end user features?<\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m trying to use this info to decide if I should wait a year for the 2019 MY even if it means just more reliable parts because they have had a year to figure things out.<\/p>\n\n<p>Any thoughts or input on this question?<\/p>\n\n<p>Any real life examples that you can share in features changes between MY for any car manufacturer?<\/p>\n<\/div>","35":"<div class=\"md\"><p>New sport car for under $30,000<\/p>\n\n<p>I know the Toyota 86 and its Subaru variant are one.<\/p>\n\n<p>Mustangs are  expensive as I live outside the US.<\/p>\n\n<p>Anything else?<\/p>\n<\/div>","36":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: Windsor, ON Canada\nPrice range: 15K-30K CAD\nLease or Buy: Buy<\/p>\n\n<p>New or used: Either <\/p>\n\n<p>Type of vehicle: Car\/Sedan<\/p>\n\n<p>Must haves:  Greater than 250hp, 4 doors<\/p>\n\n<p>Desired transmission: Manual Trans or DSG<\/p>\n\n<p>Intended use: Daily Driver<\/p>\n\n<p>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: Focus ST, Fusion Sport<\/p>\n\n<p>Is this your 1st vehicle: No<\/p>\n\n<p>Do you need a Warranty: Preferably <\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle: Yes<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle: Some<\/p>\n\n<p>Additional Notes: Working at Ford, driving one would be preferable for parking purposes.

This thing isn&#39;t a track car in the slightest and will go through tires like crazy so I&#39;m looking for a weekend car that will be tracked once a month. AMG GTS ticks all the boxes but when I drove one it felt way too big, like I was driving a barge. It&#39;s almost as heavy as my car and that bothers me, but it&#39;s got an appeal like none other, not to mention they&#39;re getting cheap (85k).<\/p>\n\n<p>The GT4 is the other contender I&#39;ve looked at and I haven&#39;t ever driven a manual on a track so I&#39;m kinda nervous I&#39;d fuck something up.

Obviously it was a corner king though which outshines my car any day of the week. These are going for around 100k right now, so I&#39;m real curious how it compares to a GT4 on the track. PDK is also a bonus. Also, I&#39;ve noticed some 911.1 Turbos have dropped to a very similar price.<\/p>\n\n<p>The 911.1 GT3 is the car I want but when I compare it to the AMG GTS, I don&#39;t see it being worth 40k more. Performance is similar, and I felt more confident when I drove it since it&#39;s obviously lighter than the GTS. But 40k more? It&#39;s a steep price.<\/p>\n\n<p>My other option I suppose is to get a Cayman S and mod the hell out of it, but I&#39;m not to thrilled about a 4 banger. I guess my real question is to AMG GTS owners or people who&#39;ve driven it on a track -- is the weight something that is just a learning curve or do you have to manage it constantly?

Primarily, this car is going to be her daily driver for a short commute (5 miles each way) that can&#39;t be done conveniently by mass transit. Most likely, every two or three weeks we&#39;re going to drive the car ~200 miles to visit her family the next state over, so ideally I&#39;d like the car to be comfortable for that three hour drive, especially for how frequent it&#39;ll be.<\/p>\n\n<p>I personally have driven the VW Golf and the Honda Civic and liked the feel of both of those cars. My fiancee hates the Civic, largely because it&#39;s too low to her liking. I think overall she likes feeling secure by being enclosed in a driver focused interior. She drove an older VW Jetta recently and liked it, and was really drawn in by the Jeep Renegade.<\/p>\n\n<p>I would ideally like a suite of safety features. I like that the Civic has Honda Sensing, and would like any car that I get to have a similar suite of skills. This is actually a hang up that I have with the new Jetta since some features (Adaptive Cruise Control, Lane Keeping Assist) are held hostage by the SEL trim, which includes other niceties like a digital driver&#39;s display and beats audio, but also raises the price by $2k. The Golf SE is priced similarly and has those features, and is also a hatchback. It looses an electronic parking break, which would be really nice to have with all the city driving we will have to do, but I can live without it if push comes to shove.<\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve also considered the Hyundai Elantra &amp; Elantra GT in a pretty cursory way. It seems really hard to pin down what the sales price of those cars are. My girlfriend also likes the Kia Soul for similar reasons why she likes the Jeep Renegade. I&#39;m worried that like the Renegade, the Soul will prove a hassle to maintain.<\/p>\n<\/div>","58":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Location:<\/strong> Tacoma, WA  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Price range:<\/strong> $11,000-$11,000 maximum  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Lease or Buy:<\/strong> Buy  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>New or used:<\/strong> Used  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Type of vehicle:<\/strong> Sedan  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Must haves:<\/strong> Reliability is extremely important!

I do do a fair amount of woodworking currently, so being able to haul my own wood is a little nice, but I can always borrow a truck when i need to pick some up, so its ultimately not a huge deal. If I get  RWD I would likely raise to 2-3 inches just for a bit more clearance, but no bigger tires or anything like that.

After extensive research over the past month, I am stuck in a pickle between a 2014 Infiniti Q60S Coupe and a the new STIs.<\/p>\n\n<p>They are completely different cars, and each achieve different things. The Infiniti is luxury, V6 330hp with no turbo, and RWD, where the Subie is 305hp with a 2.5L V4 turbo, and AWD. I love both of the cars, but the Infiniti is about $5,000 to $8,000 cheaper, depending on the trim of the STI. I really only want white in both, and the STI rarely has market-appropriate used white ones. Both would be modded, starting with exhausts, wheels, air suspension, body kits, etc.<\/p>\n\n<p>So basically, my question for you all is. What do you think is more worth it? Is a white STI worth that much more than the Q60S, where I can put the price difference into slamming it, an IPL body kit, and Motordyne exhaust setup? Those who own these cars, or work with them, please provide some advice.
