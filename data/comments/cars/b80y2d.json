Need to be able to have some kind of sleeping set up and a roof rack. My number one priority is reliability - I want this thing to be bulletproof. I don&#39;t want to be stuck in the pouring rain in the scottish highlands trying to fix anything, and even worse if this happens on an expedition further out in Europe. I also want to be able to transport a large amount of gear, but I feel like if I can sleep in it it&#39;ll be fine for that too. Ground clearance is a must - we often drive shitty roads and have to park in shitty places. Being able to wade in deep water would be ideal; we&#39;re always driving in abysmal weather conditions and through flooded roads. Go-anywhere-ability is a plus, so 4x4 really would be nice. Currently drive an &#39;04 Honda Jazz 1.4 petrol -- reliability is good, but it&#39;s not the best to sleep in, and I recently managed to kill the alternator wading through ankle-deep floodwater. Something bigger would be nice, a bit more power would be good, and if it ticks the additional box of being able to drive literally anywhere, that&#39;d be perfect.<\/p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;<\/p>\n\n<p>The options I&#39;ve looked at:<\/p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;<\/p>\n\n<p>- Landcruiser: within my budget, looks like &#39;95 with 160k-200+k miles, but usually examples don&#39;t seem to be that great (rust...). I like landcruisers - prados were the standard vehicle for my time on the White Nile in Uganda, and they would go anywhere.  Lot of autos, not many manuals about.<\/p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;<\/p>\n\n<p>- Hilux Surf (4runner): probably my favourite option. 1996-2000 3rd gen 4runners are mostly what I can find in decent condition, but they are all autos! Manual would be ideal (reliability, ease of fixing, and fuel economy). I can find some manual 2nd gens around, but they tend to be modded (one is \u00a32000, lifted w\/ skid plates, snorkel, etc and some unspecified &#39;aftermarket bits;&#39; one is 100 miles away with a bigger turbo [unspecified], intercooler, and aluminium radiator fitted). My concern with the modded ones is that engine mods will impact reliability, and insurance would screw me over on either one anyway. With any of the 4runners, I&#39;m looking at a 21+ year old car most of the time, which I&#39;m concerned about... and I guess manual 3rd gens are super hard to find even so. They all do tend to have between 80k and 160k miles within my budget -- there&#39;s some super clean 3rd gen autos around...<\/p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;<\/p>\n\n<p>- Nissan Terrano (Pathfinder): Seem to be cheaper, and I can get newer ones, and in manual. However, lots of the threads I&#39;ve read on here say to avoid them like the plague due to poor reliability and cheaper build quality.<\/p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;<\/p>\n\n<p>- Shogun: I like them, but finding one in good condition seems to be hard -- lots of rust, and a lot of them seem to have recurring suspension issues.<\/p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;<\/p>\n\n<p>- Delica: probably too old, rusty, and too little MPG, but I do like them. Maintenance also tends to be harder to do on these.<\/p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;<\/p>\n\n<p>- Vans in general: parking restrictions where I live prohibit &#39;large sided vans&#39; and &#39;campervans&#39;. Otherwise a van would probably be the way to go.<\/p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;<\/p>\n\n<p>Anyone got any advice? I really do kind of want a 4runner, but I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s the sensible choice given the age and the fact that I can only find autos rather than manuals.<\/p>\n<\/div>","3":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Yo readers, first post here (or comment in this case).<\/p>\n\n<p>I live in Italy, i&#39;m 22yo and i just got a decently paid job.

For now, my choice is between the new Ford Fiesta ST (the one with the 1.5 200cv) or a honda civic (1.5 182cv). My concerns are: maintenance costs (compared to a car around 10k, are they that much higher?) fuel consumption as a daily  (of course i don&#39;t plan to buy a &quot;sport&quot; car and then be suprised of an avg of 10l\/100km, i just want to know if i should expect even worse).

I haven&#39;t gotten it inspected in multiple years so I need to do something soon to get a new car.<\/p>\n\n<p>A friend is offering to sell me their 75k miles, 2009 Mercedes C300 Sport 4Matic Sedan for $5000.

With this purchase I will be losing the $5k obviously + the cost of a parking garage ($185\/mth) (I currently park on the street in a not amazing urban area so I&#39;ll want to switch to a garage with a nicer car) + my insurance would go from about $600\/yr (no collision) to about $1200 a year with collision.<\/p>\n\n<p>I am mostly concerned about two things:<\/p>\n\n<p>A) Is $5k a good\/bad\/reasonable price for this car, assuming very good condition?<\/p>\n\n<p>B) I&#39;ve heard that Mercedes are very expensive to fix. I&#39;m worried about having to sink another multiple grand into maintaining it in the next few years.

I found a deal online for a great looking 2006 Toyota Rav4 for a reasonable price. It has 60k miles on it but from what I&#39;ve heard about Toyota in this sub and online that shouldn&#39;t be an issue due to the notorious Toyota reliability. To sweeten the deal even further it has been modified to run on autogas alongside the regular fuel tank by a Toyota dealership. <\/p>\n\n<p>This could seriously lower my running costs and after crunching the numbers makes a lot of financial sense. However: I have talked to a mechanic friend of mine that told me LPG conversions can be quite troublesome. I am by no means an expert on autogas but some online research yielded conflicting results - some people claim that the engine is incapable of even running on LPG, some say it is possible but may destroy the engine, while others claim that they see no issues.<\/p>\n\n<p>I am very intrigued by the car but also really conflicted here. Does anybody have any advice or experiences in autogas conversions and\/or Rav4s?<\/p>\n\n<p>The Toyota is my favourite so far but I&#39;m also seriously considering the Volvo - it is fuel efficient due to the Diesel engine and at 30k miles very reasonably priced. I do however dread the upcoming maintenance costs, Volvos are hella expensive. <\/p>\n\n<p>Thanks for your time!

What if i wait until lexus releases a 2020 model so the 2016 can drop a bit closer to what the 2015 models are at right now?<\/p>\n<\/div>","104":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Location:<\/strong> MI, USA  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Price range:<\/strong> 20,000-25,000 USD  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Lease or Buy: either<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>New or used: either<\/strong>   <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Type of vehicle:<\/strong> Sedan or SUV  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Must haves:<\/strong>  AWD, Navigation,   <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc):<\/strong> auto  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Intended use:<\/strong> Daily driver   <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered:<\/strong> CTS from &#39;15-&#39;16, accord,  mazda 6 \/ cx5, chevy colorado.

Considering going back to the GTI when my lease is up, for the fun sportiness, but would like something more luxurious and maybe a bit flashy or badass (without being douchy lol).   Having a high end car, while not being super important, does have some benefits for the work I do (image-conscious clientele), so that\u2019s also a mark against the VW.   Ideal car would be an S version of the old Audi A3 wagon, or maybe a 4 door version of a bmw 2-series.....but not sure anything like that exists anymore.  City driving and city parking leads me toward a smaller car....but I still want it to be versatile enough for road trips and trips to the beach with the dog, but also suitable for driving around clients.<\/p>\n<\/div>","106":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[gel\u00f6scht]<\/p>\n<\/div>","107":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Florida United States\n0-~3500\nBuy\nUsed\nSedan\nSmooth ride, A\/C, good fuel economy\nEarly 2000&#39;s Toyota Corolla\/Celica\nMy first vehicle\nNo warranty\nI can do minor work oil change, brakes etc.\nNo major work<\/p>\n<\/div>","108":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location:\u00a0Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA<\/p>\n\n<p>Price range:\u00a050K-65K USD <\/p>\n\n<p>Lease or Buy: Buy<\/p>\n\n<p>New or used: Used<\/p>\n\n<p>Type of vehicle:\u00a0Sports car - preferrably coupe<\/p>\n\n<p>Must haves: <\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Around 2016 model or later preferred<\/li>\n<li>AWD or rear\/mid engine and RWD preferred (better for snow?)<\/li>\n<li>heated seats<\/li>\n<li>reverse camera<\/li>\n<li>bluetooth<\/li>\n<li>Active exhaust setting preferred <\/li>\n<li>wheels<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc): <\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>automatic (but with paddle shifters preferred)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Intended use: <\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Daily Driving<\/li>\n<li>Mainly will use the car for driving to and from work every day.
