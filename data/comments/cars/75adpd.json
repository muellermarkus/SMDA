The camry is a XSE (fully loaded, radar controlled cruise, blind spot, cross traffic, LED headlights, sound system, heated seats, 18\u2019 wheels), has about 19,000 miles and it has the V6 (0-60 ~5.9 secs.) So its faster then most cars, just not great in handling. The only negatives are itss an automatic, red pearl paint is chipping and hard to match, not a hatch, and Camrys are just perceived as boring. I have been leasing Camry\u2019s since 2010.<\/p>\n\n<p>The WRX is a base 2012 WRX with no mods in blue, no damage (rare!) and about 35K miles. It\u2019s a manual, sporty, and semi-practical because of the hatch body and AWD. I love driving, and this car will be a blast, and I am fairly young so I can deal with the rougher ride. I would also dabble in light mods, so it would be a bit of a hobby car. Its also faster and I can keep my dogs in the back and put a roof rack on top for anything I want. Negatives are it takes premium, would need a sound system upgrade, and I would lose all the technology, comfort, and quiet from the Camry.<\/p>\n\n<p>The biggest issue is purchase price after taxes, warranty, etc. \nCamry: $22,000 (originally 36K)\nWRX $26,000 (but will have a warranty, base car price is only 23K)\nIve been struggling and cant decide, looking for opinions: Do I go responsible and nice (Camry) or do I go fun and almost my dream car (STI) since I was in college (WRX).<\/p>\n\n<p>Thanks for the help!<\/p>\n<\/div>","21":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Looking for two cars! <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Location:<\/strong> North Jersey<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Price range:<\/strong> 1. $1500 - 3000 | 2. $5000 - $7000<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>New or used:<\/strong> Used<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Type of vehicle:<\/strong> 1.

There was also a burning smell coming from the brakes.  The car looked very nice, drove very nice, everything I could tell from looking at the engine seemed in shape and no lights on the dash were going off or anything like that. Back seats almost looked like they were never sat in and it had plenty of leg room.  <\/p>\n\n<p>I also test drove a 2016 Mazda 3 Sport priced at 13.5k with 30k miles. It had a cigarette smell to it, some minor dings, felt very cramped on my big frame and overall just felt small.  Almost no leg room in back seats for passengers.  The menu for the controls of the radio felt cool, but also a little distracting and it seemed to have a few features missing that could be added on for a couple hundred bucks here and there. The car drove nice and tight and it&#39;s acceleration felt &quot;zippy&quot;. Mechanically the car seemed in very good shape.  It also had a little bit of the warranty left (36 months on major parts).  My brain is saying this car is the practical, safe choice but I also am having a hard time getting over how small and cramped the car feels. Even the windshield seemed like it was shrunken down. Seat belt seemed to be digging into my hip and had a little sore spot for like 10 minutes after test drive. Road trips with friends seem out of the question if anyone is riding in the back, plus the rear trunk space didn&#39;t seem as big as the Impreza. There was definitely more car for my money in the Mazda 3 compared to Impreza though. <\/p>\n<\/div>","68":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[gel\u00f6scht]<\/p>\n<\/div>","69":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[entfernt]<\/p>\n<\/div>","70":"<div class=\"md\"><p>This one might be a bit of a challenge...<\/p>\n\n<p>Location: Upstate New York, Hudson Valley\nPrice range: Around $7000\nNew or used: Used\nType of vehicle: Sporty and presentable\nMust haves: Turbo, prefer AWD and hatchback (or wagon), but not a must\nDesired transmission: Auto, preferably with a manual mode\nIntended use: Sensible daily and winter car\nVehicles you&#39;ve already considered: Volvo XC70\nIs this your 1st vehicle: Nope, 6th\nDoes the vehicle need to have a warranty: Nope\nCan you do Minor work on your own vehicle: Definitely\nCan you do Major work on your own vehicle: Nothing very mechanical, suspension work is ok<\/p>\n\n<p>Additional Notes: Really prefer Japanese, but I would consider a scandinavian car, I&#39;m really just looking for a responsible and reliable car that can fit stuff and bear the winter, as my RX8 does neither of these things.

I wouldn&#39;t wanna pay too much more to switch cars since this is purely a luxury. Plus I still pay rent, so I wouldn&#39;t wanna go broke here. I don&#39;t need it to last for life, but it&#39;d be nice if I could resell it at one point. <\/p>\n<\/div>","91":"<div class=\"md\"><ul>\n<li>Location: Philadelphia, PA USA<\/li>\n<li>Price range: $5000 - $10000<\/li>\n<li>New or used: Used<\/li>\n<li>Type of vehicle: Sporty sedan or CUV\/SUV<\/li>\n<li>Must haves: decent fuel efficiency, reliable<\/li>\n<li>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc): Manual<\/li>\n<li>Intended use: Daily Driver<\/li>\n<li>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: BMW 3 series, BMW X1 and X3, Acura TSX, Acura TL, Toyota RAV4, Honda CRV<\/li>\n<li>Is this your 1st vehicle: No<\/li>\n<li>Does the vehicle need to have a warranty: Nice to have<\/li>\n<li>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle: Yes<\/li>\n<li>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle: No - i have knowledge and some experience but do not currently have the tools and space to do any major work<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>","92":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: New England<\/p>\n\n<p>Price range: up to $25k, but lower is always better<\/p>\n\n<p>New or used: used<\/p>\n\n<p>Type of vehicle: sports car or sporty hatch\/sedan<\/p>\n\n<p>Must haves: fun to drive, somewhat reliable, rwd or awd<\/p>\n\n<p>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc): manual<\/p>\n\n<p>Intended use: Daily Driver<\/p>\n\n<p>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: WRX (again?)
