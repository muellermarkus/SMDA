Do I keep that and ride it out until it&#39;s done for, or is it worth it to trade it in for $2000 and get a new car? given that I&#39;m looking for reliability, long lasting, etc. <\/p>\n\n<p>Notes: I currently drive a 2008 kia spectra EX with 111k miles on it. I got it roughly 5 years ago as a car for high school\/college, and it&#39;s been great and reliable. I&#39;ve graduated and now have to decide if I should trade in this Kia and get a new car or keep the Kia until it dies.<\/p>\n\n<p>Personally, I like the car and given it&#39;s reliable past I figure I can keep riding it, but my parents say that, given it&#39;s 111k miles, I should trade it in while it has value (probably $2000 trade in value) and get a new car. <\/p>\n\n<p>My parents will offer me $3000 towards a new car, so I&#39;d have that plus the trade in value towards a new car. With my Kia, I don&#39;t feel I&#39;m missing out on much (leather seats, heated seats, GPS, etc, I don&#39;t really care to have), I just like having decent looking Sedan that drives nice and I&#39;ve never worried about it breaking down or being expensive to repaid\/maintain. <\/p>\n\n<p>So what I&#39;m asking is, based on my options of 1) keep my Kia with 111k miles and ride that out  or 2) trade in my Kia for about $2000 and then have about $5000-9000 to go car shopping (I have about $4000 saved up)<\/p>\n\n<p>and if it&#39;s option 2, any advice on what kind of car? I&#39;m looking for something that will last a long time and be relatively cheap\/easy to maintain. <\/p>\n\n<p>Location: (Specify your country or region): Chicago suburbs<\/p>\n\n<p>Price range: (Minimum-Maximum in your local currency): $4000-10000<\/p>\n\n<p>Lease or Buy: buy<\/p>\n\n<p>New or used: used<\/p>\n\n<p>Type of vehicle: (Truck, Car, Sports Car, Sedan, Crossover, SUV, Racecar, Luxury etc.) Car, most likely Sedan<\/p>\n\n<p>Must haves: (4x4, AWD, Fuel efficient, Navigation, Turbo, V8, V6, Trunk space, Smooth ride, Leather etc.):   fuel efficient, reliable<\/p>\n\n<p>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc):  auto<\/p>\n\n<p>Intended use: (Daily Driver, Family Car, Weekend Car, Track Toy, Project Car, Work Truck, Off roading etc.) . daily driver (to work, etc)<\/p>\n\n<p>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered:  honda civic, toyota corolla, don&#39;t know too much about cars besides reddit, research, and what i hear from friends and family<\/p>\n\n<p>Is this your 1st vehicle: kind of <\/p>\n\n<p>Do you need a Warranty:  idk?<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle: (fluids, alternator, battery, brake pads etc) . no<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle: (engine and transmission, timing belt\/chains, body work, suspension etc ) . no<\/p>\n<\/div>","32":"<div class=\"md\"><p><strong>Location<\/strong>: United Kingdom, near London!<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Price range<\/strong>: min \u00a36,000 max \u00a312,000<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Lease or Buy<\/strong>: buy<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>New or used<\/strong>: used, but low mileage<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Type of vehicle<\/strong>: Hatchback<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Must haves<\/strong>: 5 doors (4d + boot), bluetooth for phone<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc)<\/strong>: Manual<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Intended use<\/strong>: Daily driver to and from university.

The clutch was annoying, but I actually did not mind the interior as much as I thought I would. The reviews all seem to place the STI in a distant third to the Focus and the Golf, so maybe I am missing something.

Owning my IS300 has given me a great appreciation of Lexus&#39;s build quality and reliability. I&#39;ve had several Subarus in the past as well, which is why the STI is on my list. However, I&#39;m having a hard time getting past the fit and finish of the interior. AWD is nice to have, but not necessary (I always throw snow tires on my vehicles for the winter). I&#39;ve considered a BMW 3-series as well, but frankly German cars worry me from a maintenance and reliability standpoint.<\/p>\n\n<p>So, essentially it&#39;s between the IS-F and the IS350 F Sport. The IS-F clearly has the performance advantage. It&#39;s one of the last sports sedans with a V-8. The suspension refresh in 2011 made it a serious machine on the track. But, it&#39;s a lot of money to spend for a 7-8 year old car, typically coming in right at my max budget for the 2011s and 2012s. The newer F-Sports have more technology and features, better gas mileage, and typically the ones in the middle of my price range have lower miles.  I also prefer the interior and exterior styling of the newer Lexuses and found the IS-F was a bit dated even when it was new. <\/p>\n\n<p>I keep going back and forth. The IS350 is a better car for daily driving and will have a lower cost of ownership. But the IS-F is a better car for the weekend.

A family member is in desperate need of a new car and has no money so we are considering giving them the civic and getting ourselves a new car and are looking for some suggestions. I am leaning towards getting a late model, low mileage used car to save money but would consider something new if there is a compelling reason to do so.<\/p>\n\n<p>Will be driven in a major city but parked in a parking garage both at home and at work. The city is full of shitty roads and shitty drivers so we will probably get something less nice than we can otherwise afford because we don&#39;t feel like ruining a nice, expensive car.<\/p>\n\n<p>the wife has an important job that keeps her very busy so reliability is very important. getting repairs is a major inconvenience and is expensive where we live. we are not able or willing to do any maintenance ourselves. we have no garage or tools.\nshe likes the size and handling of the civic but at this point in our lives we can do a bit better. we would like something a bit more &quot;luxurious&quot; but not much, if any, bigger than the civic. comfort is more important than performance since this is mostly to be driven in the city.<\/p>\n\n<p>we would like some modern amenities that we are missing out on driving a 12 year old car. things like back up camera, blind spot warnings, auto braking, etc. dont care about satellite radio or navigation since the phone does those things better anyways<\/p>\n\n<p>the idea of an electric vehicle is appealing to her and we have plugs available both at home and at work. this isn&#39;t a must but its something to consider. maybe a plug in hybrid of some type? that way she would never have to get gas during her short commute and we could still take longer drives when needed. we both like the tesla model 3 but are not willing to pay to be beta testers so that is out. maybe in 3 or 4 years I&#39;d get one.<\/p>\n\n<p>price range is about $20 - $40k. I realize that&#39;s a big range. We can afford more but don&#39;t feel like spending extra money that we don&#39;t have to. We are not looking for a status symbol, just a nice car, and like i said above, we don&#39;t want to feel too bad if\/when it gets fucked up by some idiot driver or giant pothole<\/p>\n\n<p>we rarely have passengers but I think since this is our only car its probably a good idea to have 4 doors. no need for a bunch of cargo room though.<\/p>\n\n<p>thanks for your suggestions<\/p>\n<\/div>","100":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;m looking for a crossover SUV.
