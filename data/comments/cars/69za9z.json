I am leaning towards the idea of one car vs my current setup of 2015 Elantra for winter and a 1994 Miata for summers. The Miata was fun and all, and fixing it has been a good learning experience, but I find myself wanting more power in a good chassis without having to worry about 20+ year old car problems, plus having something to daily drive year-round that is comfortable for long trips to the cabin. Fuel economy doesn&#39;t matter as much to me right now, since I work from home and may have a short commute later. I am currently 24, turning 25 in November.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>The Numbers:<\/strong> <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Miata and Elantra:<\/strong> Paid $4000 for the Miata, but have put nearly the same back into it, some of that covered by insurance. Towed every year at least 2 times. Insurance is about $483 every 6 months for 500\/500 comprehensive, collision, liability. The Elantra is a lease that I traded my Tahoe in for to cover the $3000 deposit. Costs $118\/month for the lease, and another $845 every 6 months for 500\/500 comprehensive, collision, liability. Lease lasts until 2018, and if I have it until then, I&#39;ll buy at $11k.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Chevy SS:<\/strong> It is currently listed a hair under $36,000 with around 20k miles on it, clear title. From what I am seeing online, insurance costs wouldn&#39;t change much for me, and may even go down if I didn&#39;t have the Miata and Elantra and sit at $1,000 every six months. My credit is great and I have no debt besides the leased Elantra, so I may be able to get a good car loan. I also have some money in the bank ($14,000), but I&#39;d rather keep that for a future house downpayment. Current job makes $50k with roughly $650\/week take-home. Assuming no money down (besides the potential $4000 for a rust-free Miata on low end) and a bit of wiggle room down to a loan price of $30k, payments on a 60 month term @ 3% amount to $539 per month.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Comparison:<\/strong> <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Chevy SS: $539\/month + $167\/month = $706\/month<\/p>\n\n<p>Miata and Elantra: $118\/month + $221\/month = $339\/month until Nov 2018. Assuming similar insurance costs and same loan end time (36mo after 2018): $320\/month + $221\/month = $541\/month. This does not include the repair and maintenance costs over the period of time.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Basically, it boils down to: Do I want somewhat impractical car for a daily for double current car cost, or do I stick with my cars and keep fixing the issues with the Miata, which may equal an extra $800 per year (one repair cost insurance $1700 and I paid $500, but played follow-the-broken-bits repairs that totaled over $1200, each under the $500 limit)?<\/p>\n<\/div>","72":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: Phoenix, AZ<\/p>\n\n<p>Price range: $3,500 - $12,000<\/p>\n\n<p>New or used: Used<\/p>\n\n<p>Type of vehicle: Truck or SUV<\/p>\n\n<p>Must haves: Comfortable to drive, looks decently professional<\/p>\n\n<p>Desired transmission: Probably auto<\/p>\n\n<p>Intended use: Daily driver<\/p>\n\n<p>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: Older BMW X5, older f150<\/p>\n\n<p>Is this your 1st vehicle: No, I currently own like 4<\/p>\n\n<p>Does the vehicle need to have a warranty: No<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle: Yes<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle: No<\/p>\n\n<p>Additional notes: I just bought a Honda S2000.

Almost all of the options in my area (Northern NJ) have 100k+ miles, with one going for under $5000 and looks good cosmetically but has over 170k miles. This will be a short term purchase, probably holding it for less than a year before trading it in, and only being driven regularly for about 4 months. Any feedback would be appreciated. <\/p>\n<\/div>","85":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[gel\u00f6scht]<\/p>\n<\/div>","86":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Bay Area, California.\n~5000$.\nUsed.\nManual.\nSomething fun but reliable.\nI&#39;ve been looking at e30s.\nWill be my first car.\nI can do some minor work.<\/p>\n<\/div>","87":"<div class=\"md\"><ul>\n<li> Location: NJ, USA<br\/><\/li>\n<li> Price range: 15000-20000 (or something I could negotiate to that)<br\/><\/li>\n<li> New or used: Used<br\/><\/li>\n<li> Type of vehicle: Sedan\/Coupe (Luxury)<br\/><\/li>\n<li> Must haves: AWD, Heated seats (maybe cooled), ~300hp\/tq, Bluetooth, etc<br\/><\/li>\n<li> Desired transmission: Auto (w\/paddle shifters) or manual<br\/><\/li>\n<li> Intended use: DD<br\/><\/li>\n<li> Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: \n2012-2014 Acura TL tech\/advance package<br\/><\/li>\n<li> Is this your 1st vehicle: It&#39;ll be my 5th<br\/><\/li>\n<li> Does the vehicle need to have a warranty: No<br\/><\/li>\n<li> Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle: Yes<br\/><\/li>\n<li> Can you do Major work on your own vehicle: Some, definitely detailing, some engine work.

Used preferred. 4 Door Sedan maybe a 2 door. Fuel Efficent 25+ miles per gallon or more. Manual would be nice, auto works though. Daily Driver, Delivering food. I&#39;ve thought about a Civic, Corolla, Focus, Accord, Camry, etc. No Warranty needed. I can do minor work such as oil changes, brakes, minor engine work (spark plugs, fluid changes, alternators, water pump, etc.). Anything that requires less than 2 hours of work and doesn&#39;t require the removal of numerous engine or suspension components.<\/p>\n\n<p>I own a food delivery business and put about 75-100miles a day on my current vehicles (2011 Ford Fusion). I bought the car because my 97 Honda Civic had rusted out brake lines and was too expensive too fix. I can&#39;t go even 2 hours without a vehicles because if food needs to be delivered and I&#39;m short drivers, it&#39;s me picking up the slack. So that why I bit the bullet and got the vehicle with a warranty. However, now that I have a reliable vehicle, I do want something a little cheaper, in addition to my Fusion, so I can put less miles on it. that way instead of driving it 7 days a week, I only drive it 1 or 2. <\/p>\n\n<p>I really enjoyed my Honda Civic and do believe they&#39;re reliable vehicles. The civic I had, the brake lines were completely rusted and would have costed thousands to fix which wasn&#39;t worth it. The shop that did the quote said the fuel lines and gas tank would need to be removed, which is something that I can&#39;t do. I live in an apartment with no garage so even if I wanted to learn it, I don&#39;t have the space for it. I have a pretty good idea of the kind of car I want to get, but not specifics on which is best. <\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>What&#39;s the best way to check a potential vehicles for under body rust? I live in MN\/ND and rust is a huge issue. I&#39;m not too worried about body rust, but more suspension and underbody rust but I don&#39;t know how to properly inspect that. <\/li>\n<li>I get very concerned about the engine and suspension components when buying from a private party. What are some telltale signs to look for. It really differs from vehicles, so specifically for a Honda Civic or Toyota Camry.<\/li>\n<li>I have no problems replacing things like the alternator, fuel pump, water pump, etc. Things I would see as repairs for someone that is somewhat experienced. However, I don&#39;t want to have to remove a bunch of parts to get to it. I had a 2001 Ford Focus that needed an alternator replaced. The shop quoted 5 hours because the intake manifold needed to be removed. I don&#39;t want to do repairs like that, I don&#39;t have time for it. If the alternator goes out and is a simple remove and install, I can do it in my parking spot and have it done in no time. So maybe the best option is a 90s vehicle. <\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>Give me some feedback and any options I should look into.
