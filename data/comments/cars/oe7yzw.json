My current car is a 2021 Supra and this will be be used as my dog hauler, practical car, and I will be using it to drive in the rain get out of localized street flooding and snow (if we have another freeze lol). Additional details below<\/p>\n\n<p>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: 4Runner, Highlander, RAV4, CRV, Tacoma, Lexus RX 330\/350, WV Touareg V6\/V6 TDI<\/p>\n\n<p>Is this your 1st vehicle: No<\/p>\n\n<p>Do you need a Warranty: No<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle: No<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle: No<\/p>\n\n<p>Additional Notes: so here\u2019s the rub, over the last few months the street flooding in my area has gotten worse and worse. I just moved to the area last fall but speaking to the neighbors it\u2019s never been this bad. A few hours of decent rain and our shared driveway will get flooded 3-4 inches and our driveway is lower than the street so water from the street flows into the driveway. My house is elevated so it\u2019s no problem but it\u2019s been sketchy getting in and out of the driveway and neighborhood in the Supra. I\u2019ve been wanting a second more practical vehicle anyways but I think an SUV would be great to at least get me out of my neighborhood so I can get to and from work easier. And in the event of a hurricane level flood situation, get me and my dog out before it gets crazy. I also intend to get another dog in the near future so the Supra isn\u2019t going to cut it. I\u2019m not worried about my house itself since it\u2019s elevated 3+ feet but the last few weeks of rain as me worried about getting in and out with the Supra. <\/p>\n\n<p>I\u2019ve looked at some mid to late 2000s Toyota and Honda SUVs. I really want a 4Runner those are too overpriced and ones in my range would be very high mileage. I\u2019ve seen some decent like 2007-2008 RX 350s with like 120k miles for like $9k which seems decent enough. I\u2019ve also seen some 2010-2011 Touareg\u2019s with decent tech and 100k ish miles both V6 and TDI. Are those reliable because it seems like a good deal in this price range. <\/p>\n\n<p>Would love to hear if anyone else has any suggestions on what else to look for.<\/p>\n<\/div>","5":"<div class=\"md\"><p>This question may sound stupid, but if I buy a car from a dealership all in one go (pay the whole price)\u2014I don\u2019t need to go through a credit check, right?<\/p>\n\n<p>For example, the opposite would me financing it.
