Back bumper will need to be replaced and the front side fender and bumper have scratches and damage that could be mended without replacement. I&#39;m assuming the worst: That this would cost around $1000 to repair if I go to a body shop and much more if I return the car like this and they charge me for the damage.<\/p>\n\n<p>The price to buy the car is currently $13,872. (Residual at end of lease is $13,491.) I went to CarMax and they appraised it and would buy it at $9,500 so there&#39;s no equity in the car. (right?) I have not had the car appraised by the dealer yet.<\/p>\n\n<p>I wouldn&#39;t mind leasing another car through the same dealer if they would give me a deal such as waiving the body charges, but I don&#39;t think they would do that, would they?

Please tell me if this is a huge scam cause I&#39;m not familiar with any of it:<\/p>\n\n<p>&quot;As I told\u00a0you\u00a0in my first email, got a new job and moved back to my hometown, Omaha, NE. Before leaving I had prearranged the deal with eBay so my presence isn&#39;t necessary. They won&#39;t give me any money until\u00a0you\u00a0receive and test the vehicle. It is at the shipping company, ready to be delivered. The shipping cost is included in the selling price of the vehicle!\u00a0You\u00a0got 5 days to test it and inspect the vehicle. So if\u00a0you\u00a0want to make this deal I need the following details from\u00a0you:\n-full name\n-shipping address\n-phone number\nOnce I got all the details, I will forward them to eBay and they will proceed with the order. They&#39;ll email\u00a0you\u00a0with all the information that\u00a0you\u00a0need to complete this deal and also they will confirm that the deal is conducted through them and I&#39;m a legitimate seller. Waiting for your email with the requested details.\nThank\u00a0you!&quot;<\/p>\n<\/div>","100":"<div class=\"md\"><p>How is the subaru outback ?<\/p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;<\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m looking at the 2019 since there are huge discounts (20% off msrp and 1% interest).
