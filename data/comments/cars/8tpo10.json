She&#39;ll take my RDX whereas I&#39;d take this car when needed (chores, last-minute needs to drive 10 miles into work versus bussing). We&#39;ve never bought used and I&#39;m not terribly picky, just want it to be relatively reliable\/low maintenance (if that&#39;s possible at this pricepoint). We&#39;ll eventually get a new car once we have a kid and they get a touch older (so likely in 2-3 years we&#39;ll drop on a new main car and the RDX becomes the second car), so not like I need a decade of use for this reco. I can&#39;t do any work on my own, but my dad is a mechanic and has always done the maintenance on our cars - kicker is he&#39;s down in PDX, so ideally the car would be reliable enough to drive the 3 hours back and forth on the freeway doing 70mph.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<\/div>","9":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: United States, Northern Virginia<\/p>\n\n<p>Price range: 0 - 18000 USD<\/p>\n\n<p>Lease or Buy: Buy<\/p>\n\n<p>New or used: Used<\/p>\n\n<p>Type of vehicle: Car, Sedan, Sports Car, Luxury (Any of these are good)<\/p>\n\n<p>Must haves: Beginner friendly would be nice, nothing else is a must-have<\/p>\n\n<p>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc): Auto<\/p>\n\n<p>Intended use: Daily Driving<\/p>\n\n<p>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: None<\/p>\n\n<p>Is this your 1st vehicle: Yes<\/p>\n\n<p>Do you need a Warranty: I&#39;m unsure, honestly.<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle: I can definitely learn!<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle: Nope<\/p>\n\n<p>Additional Notes:<\/p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance!<\/p>\n<\/div>","10":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: Texas<\/p>\n\n<p>Price range: Maximum 5000 USD<\/p>\n\n<p>Lease or Buy: Buy<\/p>\n\n<p>New or used: Used<\/p>\n\n<p>Type of vehicle: Sedan \/ Coupe<\/p>\n\n<p>Must haves: \/<\/p>\n\n<p>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc): Can do both<\/p>\n\n<p>Intended use: College car<\/p>\n\n<p>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: Japanese cars like Civic, Accord<\/p>\n\n<p>Is this your 1st vehicle: Yes<\/p>\n\n<p>Do you need a Warranty:<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle: I can learn<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle: No<\/p>\n\n<p>Additional Notes:<\/p>\n<\/div>","11":"<div class=\"md\"><p><strong>Location:<\/strong> Puerto Rico<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Price Range:<\/strong> up to 10,000 give or take<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Lease or Buy:<\/strong> Buy<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>New or Used:<\/strong> Either or<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Type of Vehicle:<\/strong> Sports Coupe, Sedan, Hatchback<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Must Haves:<\/strong> Honestly if its fun to drive and has decent fuel economy, doesn\u2019t have to be like 30+mpg but not something that just burns through all the fuel in one drive if you catch my drift.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Desired Transmission:<\/strong> Manual preferably<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Intended Use:<\/strong> Fun Daily Driver<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Vehicles you have already considered:<\/strong> Hyundai Elantra, Kia Forte, Golf GTI, Mazda 3\/6, Mitsubishi Lancer, Focus ST<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Is this your 1st vehicle?:<\/strong> 2nd<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you need a warranty:<\/strong> Preferably but not necesarry<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do minor work on your vehicle:<\/strong> the very basics at the moment but I\u2019m planning on learning more after my summer classes end.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do major work on your vehicle:<\/strong> Nope<\/p>\n<\/div>","12":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: Las Vegas<\/p>\n\n<p>Price range: 0-13<\/p>\n\n<p>Lease or Buy: Auto Loan<\/p>\n\n<p>New or used: Used<\/p>\n\n<p>Type of vehicle: Sedan (looking into Nissan Sentra)<\/p>\n\n<p>Must haves: Backup\/Navigation Screen (not a must have, but a big want), Cloth seating<\/p>\n\n<p>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc): Automatic<\/p>\n\n<p>Intended use: Commuting to\/from work, city travel on weekends, possibly an occasional long distance travel (Cali, Arizona, NM, Utah, Surrounding areas, etc.)<\/p>\n\n<p>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: Nissan Sentra, Hyundai Accent, Kia Forte<\/p>\n\n<p>Is this your 1st vehicle: No, first I&#39;m financing though<\/p>\n\n<p>Do you need a Warranty: Read below<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle: Can do fluids, tire change, jumper cables, not much else<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle: Not a bit<\/p>\n\n<p>Additonal Notes: I&#39;m leaning toward a CPO since it&#39;d still have the manufacturer&#39;s warranty and Extended Warranties seem to be cash grabs.

The car is paid off and I enjoy every moment with it. The tint looks great and I put some nice ESR wheels on it in hyper silver, wrapped in some grippy federal tires, and it sounds great with a resonator and muffler delete. The car is great. It\u2019s never given me a problem as I have kept up with all of the maintenance with records to prove it.<\/p>\n\n<p>A few things turn me off about the car. One, it\u2019s not quick. Two, it handles semi-okay. Three, I like turbos. Last, I don\u2019t like the idea of owning an 11 year old VW nearing 100k miles. It hasn\u2019t given me a problem and I would prefer for it to stay that way.<\/p>\n\n<p>With that said, I have considered a few different cars for my next daily driver. My main criteria is aftermarket support, reliability, and as close to 20k I can get. (Hoping for 18ish thousand).<\/p>\n\n<p>GT86\/BRZ\/FRS: Not much to say that you haven\u2019t heard or don\u2019t already know. Handles amazing, love to rev this thing out, looks great, but it will definitely leave me wanting more torque.<\/p>\n\n<p>Focus ST: Man I love this car. Comes with good power\/torque straight out of the box. Who doesn\u2019t love a good hot hatch? Throw some mud flaps on, an exhaust, BOV, and a tune, now I\u2019m a badass little rally car with loaaaads of torque all while getting good MPG. I really have nothing bad to say about this car besides the inside feeling a tad cramped, but definitely still okay. Backed by decent reliability if I\u2019m not mistaken.<\/p>\n\n<p>GTI: The gentleman\u2019s hot hatch. Love this one as well. A couple years back I drove a 2015 automatic with the paddle shifters. The car felt great and handled well (better than the ST), but it just didn\u2019t feel that quick if I remember correctly? My buddy took me out last night in his  manual GTI he just got tuned and he\u2019s got a handful of other mods (intake, down pipe, exhaust, intercooler, coils, wheels) and Jesus Christ that thing rips. So that definitely made me think hard about a GTI. Scary thing for me is VW reliability. I really don\u2019t want any problems with my car.<\/p>\n\n<p>Ecoboost Mustang: Ehhhh. Felt quick for what it is and the back end kicked out a tad when I floored it on the test drive. The huge nose is an issue but it\u2019s also the first RWD car I have driven. Love this car and I\u2019m not hating on it at all but if I get a mustang, it\u2019s gonna be a fat burbling V8 that screams bald eagles and T-Rex roars.<\/p>\n\n<p>Mazdaspeed3: Haven\u2019t had the chance to test drive one of these and it\u2019s hard to find one that\u2019s not beat up. Love the design but honestly the seats look tacky. I hear great things about these cars.<\/p>\n\n<p>Give me some opinions and help me steer in the direction of my next big purchase. Thanks for reading!

He is a mechanic and said he wants to sell a few cars because he currently owns 7. The car in question is a 2001 Buick LeSabre with 208k miles, he is looking for around $2k for it. He just got new tires for it three months ago along with a new battery. He said he is going to check it over completely before he sells it and to primary look out for antifreeze leaks. It doesn&#39;t have any rust and he has kept up maintenance on the car for the last 6 years. I am a college student looking for a car to last me the next 4 years without major repairs, and it would be a big bonus if I could drive distances with it to visit my family 7 hrs away. I haven&#39;t had a car in 4 years and my last car was a 1995 Ford Taurus that I hated because I found it far too big. I am used to driving my roommate&#39;s 2009 Chevy Impala.

Good horse power too. <\/p>\n\n<p>Transmission: auto<\/p>\n\n<p>Intended use: daily driver<\/p>\n\n<p>Vehicles ive considered: hyundai elantra, jeep patriot, jeep liberty, jeep renegade, subaru imprezsa,toyota corolla, toyota camry. <\/p>\n\n<p>Is this your 1st vehicle: yes<\/p>\n\n<p>Do you need a warrenty: unsure<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do minor work: no<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do major work:no<\/p>\n\n<p>Additional comments: I just want a car that looks cool and is reliable, with good mpg and decent features. Something recent, no earlier than 2009. Awd is not a must however I&#39;d like it. Open to an suv but most of em look like mom cars. Im open to anything. Just hesitant toward some cars because I do a lot of reading on reddit lmfao and see a lot of issues people have. <\/p>\n<\/div>","102":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[gel\u00f6scht]<\/p>\n<\/div>","103":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;m looking for input on handling the logistics of purchasing a car cross country.
