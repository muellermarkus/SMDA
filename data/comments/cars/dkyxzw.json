I\u2019ve posted here before and got predictable feedback (not a knock, I appreciate all the responses I get!).  I\u2019m particularly interested in the G70 3.3T Sport due to its performance and incredible value.  Similarly optioned German competitors would run $15-20k more out the door so it seems like a no-brainer.  What I really need is someone to try to talk me out of the genesis, and\/or other suggestions of cars with the same level of tech and comfort and performance and practicality rolled into one.  I love the idea of driving a c43, especially the gorgeous coupe, but I hate the idea of paying to maintain and repair one.  If the G70 had a coupe counterpart I would probably already own it.  Another thing that has tripped me up is the recent spy shots of the G70 facelift in Korea- anyone know how long until we might see what it looks like?  If anyone has experience owning any of the above mentioned cars or anything similar, I would love to hear what it\u2019s been like to own, how often it\u2019s been in for maintenance\/repair, general cost of ownership, any insight you can provide.\nThanks very much!!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>","20":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Location:<\/strong> USA<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Price range:<\/strong> $40k<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Lease or Buy:<\/strong> Buy<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>New or used:<\/strong> New or CPO<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Type of vehicle:<\/strong> Hatchback or SUV<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Must haves:<\/strong> Fuel efficient, Trunk space<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Manual:<\/strong><\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Intended use:<\/strong> Weekend \/ Camping <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered:<\/strong> BMW 328 wagon, Tesla 3, Kia Stinger, VW Allttack<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Is this your 1st vehicle:<\/strong> no<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Do you need a Warranty:<\/strong> yes<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> Yes<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> No<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/blockquote>\n<\/div>","21":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: Texas<\/p>\n\n<p>Price Range: Under $23000 <\/p>\n\n<p>Buy<\/p>\n\n<p>Used<\/p>\n\n<p>Type of Vehicle: Sporty daily driver I can put some decent mods on. <\/p>\n\n<p>Must haves: Manual, decently quick, reliable enough to not break down every month or so<\/p>\n\n<p>Desired Transmission: Manual<\/p>\n\n<p>Intended use: Daily driver that I can enjoy driving with some power. <\/p>\n\n<p>Vehicles Already considered: Subaru Sti (sadly somewhat over budget) Nissan 370z, Older mustangs, Volkswagen gti, frs\/brz\/86<\/p>\n\n<p>Is this my first vehicle: Technically No<\/p>\n\n<p>Warranty: Probably not since I intend to modify it. <\/p>\n\n<p>Can I do minor work to my car: Yup<\/p>\n\n<p>Can I do major work to my car: Yup but would prefer not to right after buying it<\/p>\n<\/div>","22":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Location:<\/strong> Philadelphia Greater Area  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Price range:<\/strong> 8000-18000$  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Lease or Buy: Buy<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>New or used: Used<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Type of vehicle:<\/strong> (Truck, Crossover, SUV)  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Must haves:<\/strong> (4x4)  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc): n\/a<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Intended use:<\/strong> (Packing my life and driving it around the country but between travelling will be a city car, camping\/hiking\/backpacking, mild off roading?  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: 4runner, grand cherokee, nissan frontier<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Is this your 1st vehicle: No<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you need a Warranty:<\/strong>   <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> (I&#39;m comfortable learning minor repairs)  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> No  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Additional Notes: I don&#39;t like subaru&#39;s...

With a sedan, I find the trunk space to be very limiting, and thus would like to get a vehicle where the rear seats can be put down to allow for more storage (hatchback or station wagon).<\/p>\n\n<p>I do not care how a car looks or if it has minor damage. I&#39;m not looking to impress anyone with it, just to have it be as functional as possible for my needs. I simply have no idea how to carshop. I&#39;ve asked friends, and done Carvana&#39;s &quot;car finder&quot; thing, but am still open to suggestions. I had a family friend who is a mechanic who was going to sell me his Mercedez E350 Station Wagon (his daughter&#39;s personal vehicle) for a great price, on the condition that he fix a few minor issues with it. However, he is being very lazy about it and it is likely he will not get around to doing it. <\/p>\n\n<p>I do not have much money saved up at the time being, but I have a decent credit score (~715) and can most definitely afford monthly payments. Thus, I think my price range is around 10k-20k.

My dream car is an ND Miata, but from a realistic perspective, that car, after income tax, would be equal to 1 year of salary; and it&#39;s less fuel efficient and will cost more to insure than a Corolla\/Camry\/etc. Furthermore, the 2019 ND Miata had an update to the engine and thus I&#39;d like a 2019 Miata, so perhaps in a few years I can pick one up once depreciation has kicked in. The thing I want most in a car is that I don&#39;t have to worry about it too much and overall ownership costs (gas\/insurance\/repairs) aren&#39;t high. I intend to run this car into the ground. I&#39;m also interested in older cars (10 years +) but I&#39;m concerned that there&#39;s a risk that I might have to go to the shop for problems more than once a year (excluding routine stuff like oil changes) if the car is too old\/too high mileage. If an older car might make more sense for what I want to do, then I guess I&#39;d be able to save $5,000 or more. <\/p>\n\n<p>I plan to drive around 15,000 miles a year. Currently I&#39;ve been doing calculations based on the assumption that I&#39;ll get rid of the car by the time it hits around 200-250k miles, and as such a CPO vehicle that costs 15k with 30k miles actually has a cost basis per year that&#39;s very similar to a car that&#39;s 5k less but has 80k miles, with the upside of having less worries overall. One thing I&#39;m worried about is that these calculations are based on driving the same car for 10+ years, and I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m willing to drive a Corolla or Prius for so long. 5 years for sure, but 10? 15? I don&#39;t know. If my assumptions are wrong then let me know.<\/p>\n\n<p>In terms of prior experience, when I&#39;ve needed to drive, I drive my parents&#39; Toyota Highlander (2003) or Camry Hybrid (2013).  Both have held up very well and are both around 160k miles and I have no complaints with either of those cars.
