This is actually my second RX-8 and after my first RX-8 I moved to a B5 S4 sedan, stage 3. So, I&#39;m not completely new to the idea of a fast AWD cars.<\/p>\n\n<p>As of now, I see 3 good options. I&#39;d appreciate opinions and\/or other recommendations.<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>STI<\/strong> - Most economical. For a similar price, I can get something newer, in better condition and with fewer miles on it. Since I&#39;m in Japan, I would be looking at the 2.0 engine, which seems to have a pretty good reputation. Generally, maintenance and aftermarket seems a bit more reasonably priced as well. Downsides would be an overall lack of refinement, though that&#39;s obviously not the goal with this car. I&#39;m fine with that, but for a more family focused car it can count as a downside.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>2) <strong>RS4 (4.2 V8)<\/strong> - Best all-arounder. A good mix of speed with luxury and comfort. The aftermarket options are a bit slim and pricey and any serious changes would be stepping into FI. While I&#39;d love to do that, it would be a ways down the road and may not happen before I&#39;d be looking at a new ride anyways. It&#39;s going to be higher mileage, but they seem to hold up well and the engine seems reasonably strong.<\/p>\n\n<p>3) <strong>RS6 (C6 V10)<\/strong> - Best &quot;why the hell not?&quot; So, maybe you&#39;re thinking: &quot;Didn&#39;t you just say you want manual?&quot; That would be the major downside... Every car I&#39;ve owned has been manual and I love rowing through the gears. I get the feeling this car could still put a smile on my face. I just like the idea of this car. Plenty of space. Plenty of luxury. Plenty of comfort. And it will fly. Just a tune can be a huge difference and that&#39;s reasonably affordable considering how much of a difference it can make. If it wasn&#39;t for the auto transmission, I think this might come in as my top pick.<\/p>\n\n<p>So... those are my thoughts at this point. I&#39;m still about 6 months away from pulling the trigger on anything, so still plenty of time to look at other options and plan appropriately.<\/p>\n\n<p>Any thoughts or suggestions welcome.

It was recently beaten to hell by a Colorado hail storm. It was totaled but I decided to keep it and bought it back from the insurance company. Not even a month later, some guy in a large chevy truck decided to turn my car into a pickup truck sandwich.<\/p>\n\n<p>Accident was rough, worst I&#39;ve been in but everyone is OK - I&#39;m sore.. mentally and physically.\nAnyway - part of the reason I chose to keep my car was my inability to decide on a replacement vehicle and the inherent reliability\/dependability of a car I&#39;ve been maintaining for the last 60k miles. I found a few that I liked but couldn&#39;t really decide. Here is the short list of cars I&#39;ve looked into: Infiniti Q50, Lexus GS 350 (2013+), Acura RLX (p-aws advance model, the SH-AWD model is too expensive :(), and the Acura TL.<\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve found a couple ~70k mile GS 350&#39;s for ~$23k, an 80k mile RLX for $20k, TL&#39;s in all price rangers, and the Q50 ~$23k (50k miles). I was hoping we could just chat used cars for a bit.. what would you recommend I look into? Do you like any of the options I&#39;m considering?<\/p>\n\n<p>The accident has me considering larger vehicles but I don&#39;t know much about the current offerings. I hated driving a Chevy Suburban in high school but loved my family&#39;s old 94 Nissan Pathfinder. I also really enjoyed my 1995 Nissan Maxima back in high school though it was not the most reliable vehicle.<\/p>\n\n<p>My priorities are reliability, comfortable\/luxurious interior (I&#39;m actually 6&#39;8&quot;), some speed, and gas mileage (&gt;20mpg combined, ideally).

I&#39;m going to be doing a good amount of driving in the near future, so I&#39;d like to enjoy it at least a little. I know the small budget makes this really difficult. Just wondering if anyone could recommend me something in my criteria that isn&#39;t a civic, accord, or corolla. I&#39;ve looked for those in a coupe styling and they are incredibly hard to find in my area. Also I&#39;d prefer a 6 cylinder and manual transmission.

Loved the car but it was hard to turn, drove a bit like a boat, and a challenge to parallel park.  I took the insurance payout plus some money I had saved up and bought a Chevy Sonic on a whim (and I needed a vehicle for work) because I liked the MPG, the orange trim inside (reminded me of the Monte), and it was alright to drive with a nice amount of tech features. But after driving it for a few months I realized it didn\u2019t have the pickup getting on the highway that I really wanted.  It also idled hard sometimes, kind of shaking or shuddering at stops.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Well it didn\u2019t end up mattering because about a week or so ago I got rear ended by a teen driver...yeaaa...my 2017 luck is not the best.  And because Sonic\u2019s are apparently made of plastic and toothpicks the insurance company called it a total loss and I received a $13,000 payout for it.  So I am trying to turn misfortune into a second chance to find something I really enjoy driving.  I am test driving more cars today but based on specs and reviews I cannot decide on which car of the ones I listed would be a good fit.  I am leaning towards the VW Golf because it&#39;s fun, has some decent tech, I think the \u201czip\u201d I am looking for, and also can be modded post warranty to be even more fun.  But there are some issues...not sure on the year or trim because I can probably only afford a 2015 Golf.  And the Honda Civic\/Fit is supposed to be more reliable on repairs and the Mazda3 is very slick in its own right. Mazda3 is probably the best looking out of the cars in this range.<\/p>\n\n<p>Please help! I need some opinions.  <a href=\"\/u\/galendiettinger\">u\/galendiettinger<\/a> I noticed you recommended a Golf to someone who had similar budget and wants.

Lexus IS 250 f sport AWD or Honda Accord touring either 2015-2016 somewhere there. Price range is around 29k. I found a Lexus IS 250 f sport with 33k km and it is selling for 29k... I honestly like the look of the Lexus wayyyyy better. But Honda Accord will be cheaper by like 2-5k and gas will be cheaper too. Not sure about insurance. I&#39;m a student and won&#39;t graduate anytime soon. What is the best car to get? I know most people will say Honda Accord but I mean is it that much cheaper to maintain a Honda Accord vs. Lexus IS 250 f sport? Pretty sure both are reliable so I am really unsure. I&#39;m leaning towards the Lexus but if maintaining the car is A LOT more expensive than Honda then I honestly don&#39;t know.

I&#39;m not really comfortable with more than 30k USD but could go higher (40?45?) if it was perfect. One of the reasons I want to do this research is, this tech is pretty cutting edge so there can be a big difference between buying used and new... I want used prices but I suspect I want new features.<\/p>\n<\/div>","114":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Got a chance to review last night.  First feature is as much auto pilot as possible to ease my commute. Utility is next, for hauling people and things. AWD would be nice for getting out in the country and the snow a few times a year. Finally handling, acceleration &quot;fun&quot;.<\/p>\n\n<p>Based on this the real dream items are like a Volvo wagon, Audi wagon, or golf R. Audi and golf both scored low on safety. The first two are far too expensive, the golf slightly. That leaves me looking at a forester... Maybe a outback?  I&#39;m having trouble finding info on how forester handles stop and go; some forums suggest or doesn&#39;t handle it will because it lacks electronic parking
