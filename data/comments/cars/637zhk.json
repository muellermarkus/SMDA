I&#39;ve been looking around at new cars and everything I seem to test drive feels VERY different. Here&#39;s some major points I&#39;ve noticed.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Steering wheels feel much more numb than wheels from 15 years ago. Turning doesn&#39;t feel nearly as tactile and feedback from the road surface feels dampened. I&#39;m not looking for a ultra sporty feel, but the dampened feel makes me uneasy, like I&#39;m not getting all of the feedback information I need to make the best input decision I can. I know I have a bias with my Avalon, but from driving other cars (new and older) it&#39;s got a good mix of comfort but quality feedback. Wheels seem to have also gotten smaller in diameter and thicker which I feel contributes to this.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Brakes and accelerator pedals also feel disconnected and non linear. When I test drive most modern cars, the accelerator DOES NOT feel linear. Pushing in on the pedal results in little to no acceleration, going further it usually seems to reach a very specific point where the car jolts forward. My Avalon seems to have an extremely linear accelerator. Barely pushing in results in a very small but noticeable acceleration and pushing farther results in a linear acceleration through the entire range. The brake pedals also feel similar on modern cars to me. Often times it feels like I have to REALLY push down to get the same brake motion I would on my Avalon. Some cars it feels like I&#39;m almost trying to stop the car by dragging my own feet. <\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Again, I do understand I have a pretty clear bias given I&#39;ve only driven one car consistently, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;m totally crazy here and in other forums I&#39;ve read similar complaints. Is there a reason new cars seem to follow these trends? <\/p>\n\n<p>Second part of this question. Are there any newer cars that are going to feel more like my Avalon in terms of my complaints above. I&#39;m really looking at crossovers like the Cherokee and the Rav4. I&#39;d love to try a Wrangler but I just test drove one today and the new ones really seem to suffer from the same complaints I have above. Any information would be great. <\/p>\n<\/div>","80":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Thoughts on the CR-V (AWD) vs Forester XT?

It&#39;s basically a Yaris hatchback with Prius technology. It drives with even less excitement than the already-subdued Prius, while also missing out on the comfort, interior space, and functionality. Not worth it.<\/p>\n\n<p>The Honda Fit is probably your best bet here. It&#39;s fuel efficient, comfortable, flexible, and well priced. It&#39;s fairly fun to drive, and it actually keeps its composure, which is hard to find in a car this size (at this price).<\/p>\n\n<p>The Fiesta has one major one-up on the Fit: its automatic option is a dual-clutch, which makes it almost as fun to drive as its manual option (the Fit&#39;s CVT isn&#39;t bad, but isn&#39;t the best). Ford hasn&#39;t made a chassis that&#39;s as ideal as the Honda Fit, but it certainly gives it a run for its money.<\/p>\n\n<p>A Fiesta Titanium is in your budget, with leather seats and some nice features. You&#39;ll need to leave out leather seats on the Fit, since you&#39;ll want one in the EX trim to stay in your budget. Definitely test drive both and see which one you prefer.<\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ll give you one honorable mention: the Toyota Yaris iA. Sadly, the Yaris hatchback is crappy, but the Yaris iA sedan is actually a great car. This is because it&#39;s actually a Mazda 2, just rebadged for the US market for some reason. It&#39;s one of the most fun-to-drive, engaging subcompact cars on the market. It also has no trims or options: just pick a transmission and a color, and all the features you want come standard. The downside is that its trunk isn&#39;t huge, but if you try it and like it, you should strongly consider it.<\/p>\n<\/div>","125":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I suppose I&#39;m more concerned with reliability than cost.
