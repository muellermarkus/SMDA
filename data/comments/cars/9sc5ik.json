They both look nicer and more aggressive, especially the quad, imo. But they&#39;re slower, not as nice interiors AND more expensive. The RS3, especially after an APR stage 1 tune, crushes the M2. The quad is almost as fast, but has a torque converter (dry heave) and I&#39;m seriously worried about how it will daily in the winter even with winter tires.

My budget is around 9k and after some research I\u2019ve narrowed down my options to some cars, but looking to either get a Honda Civic Vti\/L (2005-09) or the Mazda3 Maxx\/Sport (2005-10); both sedan models. <\/p>\n\n<p>The other cars I\u2019m considering but down on my list is the Mitsubishi Lancer or Toyota Corolla. Don\u2019t really like the Lancer\u2019s exterior design but heard it\u2019s a reliable first car and driving experience is nice. Corolla would probably be the safest and most reliable option but the driving experience to me is dull, feels more like an A to B type of car. I much rather pay a bit more to get a car that makes me feel like driving. I\u2019m also trying to get into cars, so I\u2019m relatively inexperienced when it comes to this kind of stuff, except knowing some of the basics. <\/p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m leaning towards the Mazda as I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s a more fun car to drive compared to Civic but like to ask the Mazda3 owners on this sub if there is anything I should look out for when buying a used Mazda3 that was made in 05-10? Any issues with any of the particular earlier models that I should check with the seller to see if they serviced it properly? And if a Corolla is a 10 in reliability and maintenance and a Honda is a 9, would it be fair to say a Mazda is a solid 8 or so? Just don\u2019t want it to be breaking down on me too often and then costing me too much to get it repaired. Yes my parents are well off enough to help me with costs but I much rather finance the costs to run the car just by myself without to much of their help.<\/p>\n\n<p>I\u2019ve read that the early models were prone to rusting, how much of an issue is that? And if so where or what should I check for rusting when inspecting the car? Most of the Mazda3s I\u2019m looking at has a  2.0L engine and around 100K on the clock, if that makes any difference. Heard 2.5L is a much better drive but I think as a uni student I rather opt for the 2.0 to get more efficient gas mileage.<\/p>\n\n<p>Sorry for the long post.

My main concerns with the 370z and FRS are that I don&#39;t really have the space where I live to store a separate set of winter tires\/wheels, so I&#39;d have to use all seasons which isn&#39;t exactly ideal for winter+rwd. My problem with the VW is that I really don&#39;t have a lot of faith in the long term reliability of most modern german cars, especially considering repair costs. The same goes for the ralliart, since mitsubishi has long since stopped making anything performance related for years now and they didn&#39;t exactly have the most stellar reputation for reliability to begin with. I&#39;d like a WRX but the only ones I can afford in auto are the older ones, and those are non-shiftable 4 speed transmissions, not exactly ideal. The Veloster turbo I don&#39;t really have a ton of information on, so I can&#39;t really make too much of a judgement on it but it isn&#39;t really on the top of my preferred list.<br\/>\ntldr; is it feasible driving something like an FR-S in NYC year round on good all season tires, or should I compromise and get something like a hot hatch?

I&#39;ve rebuilt cars in the past but probably would rather just have someone else do major work at this point. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Additional Notes:<\/strong>  So I&#39;m possibly looking into moving from Southern Indiana to Western Michigan and currently drive a &#39;16 Mustang. I need something a lot more reliable for the Michigan winters and also capable of carrying\/hauling a decent amount.  I currently just borrow my fathers Sierra if i need it but won&#39;t have that option.  I had a &#39;15 Sierra that I sold to my father and bought my Mustang last Spring. I also want it to be ready for visitors so i can drive friends\/family around.  Really been leaning towards the Grand Cherokee or Acadia, I&#39;m not a big fan of the Infotainment system the mustang has and the Explorers I&#39;ve seen have the same one. This would become the daily driver in the winter while probably 50\/50 with the mustang in the summer.  My girlfriend has a Subaru that she loves but also want&#39;s the option of the SUV when needed. She won&#39;t drive the Mustang unless it&#39;s an emergency as it&#39;s a manual and she hates it, so it likely will be a &quot;daily driver&quot; between the two of us.  Any thoughts or recommendations are appreciated and I&#39;m open to ideas!<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<\/div>","69":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: Orlando, Florida<\/p>\n\n<p>Price Range: 20,000 - 80,000<\/p>\n\n<p>New or used: New\/CPO (need warranty for germans)<\/p>\n\n<p>Type of Vehicle: Sports Car<\/p>\n\n<p>Must haves: Lower than 6 second 0-60<\/p>\n\n<p>Transmission: Prefer Manual<\/p>\n\n<p>Intended Use: Daily, Weekend car<\/p>\n\n<p>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: MX-5 Miata, Audi RS3, Audi TT-RS, C7 Corvette, Porsche 718 Cayman S, BMW M2, Mercedes Benz C63s AMG (coupe), Mustang GT Premium, Civic Si, Civic Type R<\/p>\n\n<p>Is this your 1st vehicle: No<\/p>\n\n<p>Do you need a Warranty: For German cars, except *maybe* Porsche.<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle: I&#39;d like to learn, but with some of these cars that would be impossible.<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Major work: No<\/p>\n\n<p>Additional Notes:<\/p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;<\/p>\n\n<p>I was pretty dead set on the M2.
