Cheers.<\/p>\n<\/div>","7":"<div class=\"md\"><p><em>I&#39;m looking to buy a new, fun car. I have owned a 2008 Mitsubisihi Lancer Evolution GSR for the past 7 years. It&#39;s one of my dream cars, but the years have not been kind to it, particularly the winters. I very much DON&#39;T want to get rid of it, but it&#39;s getting harder to justify keeping it. It was my daily driver for most of the time I&#39;ve owned it, but now that I have an Outlander Sport to daily around town, I think it&#39;s time to get something fresh, start over, and consider vehicles with less practicality.<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p><em>I was VERY attracted to the Miata RF, and was certain that&#39;s what I would go for; I have a small-displacement sportbike (Yamaha R3) which is great fun because it&#39;s light, nimble, and gets off the line quick even if it doesn&#39;t have the highest top speed. But the new Civic Si started pulling my attention recently, which then made me think &quot;Why not just wait and see about the Type-R?&quot; and &quot;will the Si be fun ENOUGH as my sports car, or would it make a better sporty-daily?&quot;. Ultimately, I want a vehicle that will allow for easy modification. I don&#39;t need (or really want) to make the highest HP numbers; rather, I want something that behaves like a proper sports car when pushed but isn&#39;t a chore to drive (like my Evo has become, but that&#39;s mostly my fault). So I thought I would open this up to discussion on <a href=\"\/r\/Cars\">\/r\/Cars<\/a> thoughts about the ~$30k sporty car market.

We have a 2016 Silverardo and a 2012 Jeep Grand Cherokee kid hauler.   I used to have a Buick Regal GS, but had some issues with it (multiple wheel bearing housing replacements) despite loving driving that car.  Turned it in for a Silverado Pick-up last year because of issues, and for a hobby towing vehicle\/commuter. Changed jobs in the past year though and my former 6 mile urban round trip commute turned into a 50+ mile open road round trip commute a day. Gas is getting ridiculous. <\/p>\n\n<p>I miss my moments of zen I had in the Buick.  Would be daily driving when the weather is nice, back to the Silverado when the weather is crappy.  Something fun, and efficient.  Wife would need to drive it long distance for her job at various times, so she would have to be on board.  I have 2 kids, and would like to be able to pick them up from school at times, but that&#39;s not a deal breaker.  I can do general maintenance and repairs myself, but don&#39;t want it to be cost prohibitive if I do need to take it in to the shop.  I have driven a Mustang recently, and it was fine, but I wasn&#39;t 100% sold on it. (It was a 2016 5.0 GT that a family member owns - I would be getting something a little less).  <\/p>\n\n<p>I wouldn&#39;t mind a Miata, but the wife is wavering...especially with a manual\/2 seats. She does more urban driving than I.  She hates hatch backs, but I might be able to talk her into a GTI if I can prove it&#39;s the best thing on our list in other areas, though I have never driven one (my sister-in-law swears by Golfs though and has had one...but she doesn&#39;t have one now).  Come from a long time GM family, but that has loosened considerably in the past few years.  Needs to be small enough to fit in the garage next to the jeep.  We have a considerable garage in terms of space, but I don&#39;t want an SUV or full size. Smaller the better. <\/p>\n\n<p>I wouldn&#39;t be track-day bro&#39;ing it, but I do like to tinker. My son is turning 11 and getting into cars, and would like to get him under the hood with me.  Maybe something he can buy off me, or I can allow him to use in 5-6 years. So nothing to insurance prohibitive.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Not to heavy mileage because I&#39;d like to keep for a while.<\/p>\n\n<p>Never liked Hondas or Toyotas from (or Lexus\/Acura for that matter) from an astectic stand point....and I still have some of that &quot;BUY &#39;MURICA&quot;ism in me from my formative years in the Motor City. OK with the American brands.  Have been surprised with Mazdas that friend has though. Kind of ambivalent on Nissan. Like Subarus.  Loved the semi-German feeling of my Buick, and have driven BMW&#39;s\/Porsche&#39;s before sparingly.  <\/p>\n\n<p>My uncle has offered to sell me his 2002 911\/996 base cabriolet, but I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s the right car for me. Plus I&#39;d be worried about gas mileage, and maintenance cost. I don&#39;t know if he&#39;s had the IMS bearing looked at (not sure how much of a potential problem that is, and how much its&#39; overblown).  He&#39;s downsizing, this was his fun car.  I haven&#39;t seen it in a year and I&#39;m unsure on it&#39;s mileage overall condition. While I doubt he&#39;d drive it hard (or much at all), he&#39;s not the original owner (he&#39;s had it for 5-6 years).  <\/p>\n\n<p>Open to any ideas. <\/p>\n<\/div>","11":"<div class=\"md\"><p><strong>Location:<\/strong> Mississippi Delta<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Price range:<\/strong> $30k-$55k<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>New or used:<\/strong> New<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Type of vehicle:<\/strong> Luxury SUV\/Crossover - used for lots of highway travel<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Desired transmission:<\/strong> Auto, as if there were a choice<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Intended use:<\/strong> Daily driver, lots of highway driving to visit family<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered:<\/strong> Audi Q5\/7, Acura MDX\/RDX, Cadillac XT5<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Is this your 1st vehicle:<\/strong> N<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Does the vehicle need to have a warranty:<\/strong> Y<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> Can, but don&#39;t want to.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> No<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Additional Notes:<\/strong> This is for my parents - they live in MS, my brother lives in Arkansas, I live in Virginia.
