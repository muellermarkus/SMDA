Rather than do a <a href=\"\/r\/Volkswagen\">\/r\/Volkswagen<\/a> or <a href=\"\/r\/Mazda\">\/r\/Mazda<\/a> post, I thought I should hear more from maybe somebody with more knowledge. I&#39;m currently doing an 80 mile round trip commute every day totaling about 400 miles a week. Doing this in my Lexus IS300 SportCross has been hell (It&#39;s got about 160k miles and recently had some things swapped out to preserve life) but I can last for another year or so before the loan&#39;s done and I&#39;ll want to get as much value left over the car. <\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve narrowed it down to two possible vehicles: 2014+ Mazda 3 S Grand Touring (for the performance\/trims\/extras) or the &#39;16 VW GTI (performance + Android Auto is nice) and I&#39;m trying to decide between the two. <\/p>\n\n<p>What would people recommend between the two? Does the Mazda 3 get the reported gas mileage or does it take being very conservative in order to get it? For the Mazda 3, it seems to get up to 27 city \/ 37 highway for anticipated combined 32mpg, but is it really going to get that much or is more along the lines of 30mpg which is close to the GTI? <\/p>\n\n<p>For the GTI, is the reliability going to be good enough? Will value hold over when I anticipate having an extra 80k miles on it by 2022? I&#39;m considering this car to last me until then, without any major issues\/maintenance requirements and then looking at the electric vehicle market (maybe even the VW electric line up). I&#39;m pretty torn between the two and can&#39;t seem to narrow down a decision.<\/p>\n<\/div>","11":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: Indiana, usa<\/p>\n\n<p>Price range: 10-16k USD<\/p>\n\n<p>New or used: used<\/p>\n\n<p>Type of vehicle: hatchback, coupe, sedan<\/p>\n\n<p>Must haves: less than 50,000 miles, turbo would be nice<\/p>\n\n<p>Desired transmission: manual<\/p>\n\n<p>Intended use: Daily Driver<\/p>\n\n<p>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: fiat 500 Abarth, Mazda Miata, Volkswagen GTI, jeep renegade,<\/p>\n\n<p>Is this your 1st vehicle: no, 2004 GMC sierra 2500hd was my first car i will be giving to my dad<\/p>\n\n<p>Does the vehicle need to have a warranty: no, but that would be nice<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle: yes<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle: no<\/p>\n\n<p>Additional Notes: the only car i have test driven was a 2016 jeep renegade with 8000 miles on it, it had a warranty, \n6 speed manual and a 1.4L turbo engine, it was pretty nice.<\/p>\n<\/div>","12":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: New Jersey<\/p>\n\n<p>Price range: Less than $80K<\/p>\n\n<p>New or used: Either<\/p>\n\n<p>Type of vehicle: Coupe.<\/p>\n\n<p>Must haves: RWD, V8+, navigation, leather, amazing exhaust note<\/p>\n\n<p>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc): Preferably manual.<\/p>\n\n<p>Intended use: Second\/weekend car.
