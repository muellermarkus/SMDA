I live in an apartment now with no garage so doing my own wrenching isn&#39;t something I do anymore.  I&#39;m currently driving a 135i N55 which I like the engine, but not the handling and not the very high parts cost.  I previously had an RX-8 and several Miatas, which I loved the handling but didn&#39;t like the lack of torque and power.  I have driven the 350Z when I was buying the RX-8 and it was &#39;ok&#39;, but I didn&#39;t like the handling.  I&#39;ve also driven a modified FR-S which was a lot of fun, but still low on power.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>","2":"<div class=\"md\"><ul>\n<li>Location: MD, USA<\/li>\n<li>Price range: 25k-40k<\/li>\n<li>New or used: Preferably new, but used is fine<\/li>\n<li>Type of vehicle: Midsize SUV<\/li>\n<li>Must haves: 2 captain seats and 3 seats in the third row.

It looks like the Highlander might support the right seating configuration as well, but I can&#39;t seem to tell from the pictures available on the Toyota website. Really we just care about ease of access to the back row, so if it is 2-3-2 but the middle seat in the 2nd row folds down then that can work as well.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>","3":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: Dreams, MY<\/p>\n\n<p>Price range: $150-200k ish <\/p>\n\n<p>New or used: used<\/p>\n\n<p>Type of vehicle: Racecar for the road<\/p>\n\n<p>Must haves: mid engine, manual, raw<\/p>\n\n<p>Desired transmission: manual <\/p>\n\n<p>Intended use: weekend and track <\/p>\n\n<p>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: Superformance GT40, Detamaso Pantera, 997 GT3RS, building a 69-73 hotrod 911<\/p>\n\n<p>Is this your 1st vehicle: no<\/p>\n\n<p>Does the vehicle need to have a warranty: lol<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle: yes<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle: no<\/p>\n\n<p>Additional Notes: Most fun thing you can think of that will scare you shitless but still be comfortable enough to drive around town.<\/p>\n<\/div>","4":"<div class=\"md\"><ul>\n<li>Location: Dallas, TX, USA<\/li>\n<li>Price range: $20,000-$40,000<\/li>\n<li>New or used: Used<\/li>\n<li>Type of vehicle: Sports Car and\/or Luxury<\/li>\n<li>Must haves: Trunk space, that <em>look,<\/em> Fuel-efficient is nice<\/li>\n<li>Desired transmission: I enjoy driving a stick, but not a deal-killer<\/li>\n<li>Intended use: Business car<\/li>\n<li>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: Tesla Model S, 2016 Cadillac ELR, 2015 Mercedes-Benz CLS-Class, 2015 Ford Mustang, 2011 Jaguar XF<\/li>\n<li>Is this your 1st vehicle: No. Currently drive a 2012 Ford Fusion<\/li>\n<li>Does the vehicle need to have a warranty: I think so!<\/li>\n<li>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle: I can jumpstart it and put air in the tires<\/li>\n<li>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle: No<\/li>\n<li>Additional Notes: I am a Realtor, aged 32, I want to have a very beautiful and mature-looking car, nothing too flashy that a 20-year old would drive, but also not an old man&#39;s car.

I want a reliable car that is small (expensive taxes based on car weight), and efficient with fuel (petrol is very expensive here, approx 1.66 euro\/lt).

My main hangup is that I can&#39;t decide if I want something big and powerful (e.g. Mustang) to make the long straight roads that I drive on most of the time more fun, or something small and nimble (e.g. 86\/BRZ) for the mountain roads on the weekends, and get better gas mileage.

I would like to stick to my minimum 35k but can go a little up from that. I hold a lease with Toyota so I&#39;m not sure if that would land me a good deal for a prius prime premium, I&#39;m guessing not. Initially I wanted a convertible, but the prices for those are  little over 40k, except the miata.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>","101":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: Maryland, but I&#39;ll travel across the USA<\/p>\n\n<p>Price range: $50k or less<\/p>\n\n<p>New or used: used is fine<\/p>\n\n<p>Type of vehicle: sporty car<\/p>\n\n<p>Must haves: awd or rwd, made after 1990<\/p>\n\n<p>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc): manual<\/p>\n\n<p>Intended use: project car\/fun times car<\/p>\n\n<p>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: 818c kit car<\/p>\n\n<p>Is this your 1st vehicle: yes (got any tips for a new car enthusiast?)<\/p>\n\n<p>Does the vehicle need to have a warranty: no<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle: yes<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle: probably<\/p>\n\n<p>Additional Notes: I don&#39;t care about mileage, I&#39;m probably going to engine swap it.
