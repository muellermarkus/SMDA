I&#39;m looking for something with awd\/4wd and cargo room. I miss having a bit of ride height and the confidence an awd sytem brings during PA winters. I also like to hit some winding roads like most everyone does, but these two things are hard to find in a package deal.<\/p>\n\n<p>Im not near test drive phase yet but here are the cars I&#39;ve been researching:<\/p>\n\n<p>2012ish xterra: love the truck like look and frame, strong powerplant with plenty of room. Apparently by this year Nissan sorted out the smod. A big ol&#39; truck with the bare minimum of creature comforts and tech features is my cup of tea. This is the kind of car I wouldn&#39;t mind seeing a couple dings on or taking through some brush.<\/p>\n\n<p>Cons: I&#39;d never need that much off road prowess, it would see tight gravel roads and the occasional beach at max. I&#39;d imagine it&#39;s driving characteristics to be that of a truck which I&#39;m unsure I could put up with for long. This is the kind of thing I&#39;d like to throw around on weekends, but maybe not live in it day to day.<\/p>\n\n<p>2012ish Tiguan: This is exactly what I&#39;m looking for, I love the boxy styling and the interior is fantastic. It&#39;s a GTI on stilts, so there is still some fun to be had driving it. You can even get an APR tune if you want.<\/p>\n\n<p>Cons: it&#39;s easier to list what doesn&#39;t go wrong on these, when looking into this car it became tiresome keeping track of all the issues people had.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>2015 CX5<\/strong> I&#39;ve read that these handle well for their size, which is a big pro. The gas mileage is great and it&#39;s the perfect amount of cargo space. I think they look great, too. <\/p>\n\n<p>Cons: I&#39;ve seen a lot of people describe the engine as gutless and without even driving it I&#39;m guessing that&#39;s accurate. That really isn&#39;t a big deal, I&#39;d never tow anything and I&#39;m not looking 0-60 times here. I&#39;d have to drive it to know for sure, which is another con since at the moment it&#39;s a bit outside my budget.<\/p>\n\n<p>2010ish rav4 v6: I like this one a lot, the v6 option seems like a must. The hard lines of the interior look great to me and I actually like the exterior styling. The gas mileage is good, too.<\/p>\n\n<p>Cons: I can&#39;t look at it and not immediately think soccer mom. I saw 10 of them on my way to work. These are really stupid cons but I&#39;ve got to be honest with myself. I think the only way I&#39;d be happy driving one is if I got some meaty tires and a roof rack. Plus the AWD seems shitty.<\/p>\n\n<p>2008 rdx: The shawd has been praised by many a reviewers and the thought of a turbocharged k series in a cross over tickles my fancy. I really like the interior and the way car looks from certain angles. I could throw some gear in the back for a weekend trip and hit some back roads while in a plush interior.<\/p>\n\n<p>Cons: Shitty gas mileage with a premium price tag and weighs 4000lbs. Looks indredibly silly from the side and the front beak is only slighter better than that of the next year&#39;s model.<\/p>\n\n<p>2009 forester XT: I&#39;ve always had a soft spot for foresters. I like the exterior styling on these a little better than the previous generations, there&#39;s just a bit more bulk to them which I think is nice. Subarus lauded AWD system is something I always wanted to get familiar with. That with a turbocharged boxer sounds good to me.<\/p>\n\n<p>Cons: This the only car I can&#39;t stand the stock ride height of. I think I&#39;d have to get coilovers and give it a more wagony sillouete to be happy. Another big con for me is the interior, I despise the flowy curvature of the dashboard.<\/p>\n\n<p>2011 ex35: This is a weird one for me. I think I only like what it could be, which is a true g35 hatchback. The RWD bias and 300 hp alongside infiniti&#39;s road manners sound like a winner for someone who still wants to lift a hatch and throw some gear into it. It&#39;s more car like than anything I&#39;ve been looking at and it seems like a good fit for a no-kids guy like myself. It comes with a ton of tech stuff and has a nice interior.<\/p>\n\n<p>Cons: It doesn&#39;t look good. As a matter of fact I can barely tell what it looks like, everytime I see one it seems to morph and shift with new strange viewing angles. It also doesn&#39;t have a ton of space and the dash board makes it look like two of those baby bouncer things.<\/p>\n\n<p>2012 Glk350: I would never get this car but I&#39;d like to mention it because It checks off all the boxes for me. I&#39;d love to get one of these and do all the wrong things to it. Take it down some rough fire roads, stick a bunch of window decals on it, hammer out some dents, never give it a bath etc...<\/p>\n\n<p>There&#39;s hard lines all over the place, a boxy exterior, perfect size for weekend trips or city driving, a utilitarian interior wrapped in luxury, brawny v6 with a RWD bias. It&#39;s the affluent suburban mothers chariot but I don&#39;t care, I drool over these.<\/p>\n\n<p>Cons: German luxury run away.<\/p>\n\n<p>This is my short list as of now. While I don&#39;t expect too many people to weigh in on a stranger&#39;s decision to buy a car it was helpful to actually write this out.<\/p>\n\n<p>But if you do have suggestions or experience with any of the aforementioned cars I would appreciate it.<\/p>\n<\/div>","10":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: US - Cincinnati, OH<\/p>\n\n<p>Price Range: $15,000 - $20,000<\/p>\n\n<p>Used<\/p>\n\n<p>Type: Sports Car (Coupe or Sedan), Hot Hatch<\/p>\n\n<p>Must haves: Not terribly picky.
