My complaints with the Subaru are uncomfortable seats for my 5-10 200 lbs body, and it does not fit my skis lengthwise, CVT unreliability, and my bike takes up the majority of the cargo space at all times.  I never take my gear out of the car.  I like that it has good visibility, gas milage, and AWD.  <\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m putting safe cars at the top of my list, and feel like full sized trucks may be a little too big.  I test drove the ranger, and the interior felt too small.  The Ridgeline had a enough space inside, and the Colorado felt pretty good in that aspect.  I think the Colorado looks better than the Ridgline. I like how the Ridgline has a tapered front end while driving, because it doesn&#39;t feel like I have a huge hood. <\/p>\n\n<p>I used to drive an XC volvo wagon, and loved the seats, and how much like a tank the car felt.  I do like wagons, but I think I may need more space.  I don&#39;t need something super reliable, but I&#39;m not going to buy a high milage euro import either.  Hybrid technology is big plus and I really like the instant acceleration of some hybrid models.  <\/p>\n\n<p>I drive slow AF, and need something big enough to where I can be a bit defensive and not get pushed around.  I like the idea of putting all of my gear in a truck bed, but I need 4 doors, and I would have to take the front wheel of my bike off to jam it in a 5ft bed with a shell.  So i&#39;m looking at larger SUVS as well so I can role my bike in without removing the front wheel.  <\/p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t like fabric seats, because of dog hair.  Cheap pleather is just fine though.  I could care less about tech, or cheap interiors, I just want a comfortable seat that feels big enough.  I have a beat up Chevy van that I use for construction, so I&#39;m mostly looking for a daily driver that can carry gear in all weather. <\/p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t really like the look of crossovers with a slanted back, and prefer more square back ends, but gas millage wins that battle.  I know that I&#39;ve given you the impossible task of finding me a good fit, but your input might help the poor car salesmen that keep getting rejected by me after test dives. <\/p>\n\n<p>Thanks<\/p>\n<\/div>","31":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: Maine, USA<\/p>\n\n<p>Price range: 300-450 a Month<\/p>\n\n<p>Lease or Buy: Lease<\/p>\n\n<p>New or used: New<\/p>\n\n<p>Type of vehicle: Car\/Sports car\/Cuv\/Suv<\/p>\n\n<p>Must haves: FWD\/AWD, 4 doors, around a 6 second or less 0-60 and fun to drive<\/p>\n\n<p>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc): Auto<\/p>\n\n<p>Intended use: Daily Driver<\/p>\n\n<p>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: Mazda 3 turbo, Volvo S60, Golf Gti, Honda Accord 2.0T<\/p>\n\n<p>Is this your 1st vehicle: No<\/p>\n\n<p>Do you need a Warranty: Yes<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle:No<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle: No<\/p>\n\n<p>Additional Notes: Just looking to see what options I may have to Lease in my price range.

I was planning to purchase a Ferrari 458 spider but now I&#39;m having reservations. Since I work in sales, I really don&#39;t want to risk my customers using a competitor since &quot;xxxx has a Ferrari, he obviously doesn&#39;t need the money.&quot; I am ok putting the Ferrari on hold for a few years but would really like a fun, fast car to hold me over until then.<\/p>\n\n<p>I need something that isn&#39;t too flashy and doesn&#39;t put off the &quot;makes too much money already&quot; vibe. I&#39;ve considered a debadged 992 Turbo, but even a &quot;brand new Porsche&quot; doesn&#39;t send a great message to customers, regardless of whether its a $200k 992 or a $100k base model. I think something that is perceived to cost about 80k is ideal. <\/p>\n\n<p>Considered a used 997 or 991 911 of some kind too. I prefer naturally aspirated cars.  Considered an R8 too since Audi isn&#39;t as flashy of a name, but it&#39;s still a &quot;supercar&quot; at the end of the day.<\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;d really love a convertible to enjoy the SoCal sun, but I&#39;m not 100% stuck on it. I would say I&#39;m 95% set on a convertible though.<\/p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t like Corvettes or Mercedes, my wife wasn&#39;t really on board with a GTR or NSX since &quot;we&#39;re not 22 anymore.&quot; I&#39;ve owned a few Audi&#39;s and like them. An RS5 or BMW M4\/6\/8 convertible seems like a decent option but they don&#39;t really excite me. Maybe I should go drive one though. A nice E93 M3 Convertible with a V8 could work, its a few years old, most people just see it as a BMW convertible.<\/p>\n\n<p>Needs to be comfortable enough to drive up and down the CA coast for wine tasting trips 1-2 times a year.<\/p>\n\n<p>Really want something pretty fast, was hoping for 550+ hp but I&#39;m willing to consider something with less if it checks the boxes.<\/p>\n\n<p>What am I missing here?
