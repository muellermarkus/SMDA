Im looking to buy a new car in March. im looking to spend no more than around $15,000. Im really interested in Volkswagen (2015 Jetta GLI\/ 2015 GTI between 30-55k miles), Hyundai Sonata Sport (2015 between 25-40k miles) and lastly im a big Audi fan( 2014\/2015 A3\/A4 between 30-40K miles). I know everyone will say Audi is too expensive, but as i live in Boston, AWD just seems like a necessity. I would like to know if anyone has feedback on Cost of ownership, and reliability. Most of the work to be considered will most likely be done myself. My friend is a mechanical engineer, as well as own a mechanic shop. I would only be paying for parts. Any advice on which avenue to take would be HIGHLY appreciated as this is my first time buying a car, and a long commitment.<\/p>\n\n<p>PS: ive seen alot of infiniti advocates in this sub, I would not be opposed to a 2013 Infiniti G37x, however the mileage would be higher, 50-60k.<\/p>\n<\/div>","81":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Yesterday, I asked about software tunes for my dream car.
