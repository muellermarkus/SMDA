I have never owned a car before, but I am not a teen either, so I need something a bit more presentable without being a &quot;mom&quot; car or a junker. I can afford some maintenance, so I don&#39;t mind springing for a slightly better brand if that means better safety and a little more clout. I don&#39;t mind hybrid vehicles but I really just can&#39;t stand the way the classic prius looks. I am also a short driver (5&#39;0&quot;), but will be sharing the car with a tall driver (6&#39;0&quot;), so I need something that can fit us both. I do not like SUVs as they tend to sit too high up off the ground; also not a fan of minivans. Don&#39;t mind a larger car, but not looking for a truck as I&#39;ll probably be transporting people more than things.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<\/div>","15":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: Omaha, US<\/p>\n\n<p>Price Range: $8k-$11k USD<\/p>\n\n<p>Lease or Buy: Buy<\/p>\n\n<p>New or Used: Used<\/p>\n\n<p>Type of vehicle: Sedan, Hatch<\/p>\n\n<p>Must haves: Reliable, Decent Value, S.a.f.e.

I own a company that sells commercial kitchen equipment, and I am purchasing a vehicle for personal use that very occasionally (maybe 1-2 times a year) needs to haul items weighing less than 5000lbs.   <\/p>\n\n<p>Because of the hauling aspect, I have been advised to buy a truck, namely a Ford F-150. The problem is that I live in an apartment in a city where parking spots are tight, plus I don&#39;t necessarily enjoy driving a huge truck on a daily basis, especially since I might use it (as an actual truck) seldomely at best. Plus newer model F150s are very expensive for anything with leather in it for some reason.  <\/p>\n\n<p>I then looked at the Toyota 4Runner. I like that it is a little smaller, easier to drive, seems bulletproof, has a decently high towing capacity, and the resell value is rediculous. I just worry that the towing capacity may be limiting, and I will rarely use it for off-roading like it is intended.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Any recommendations between the 2 options?
