repairs and maintenance yourself. <\/p>\n\n<p>A good rule of thumb when buying a car is: If you can\u2019t afford it twice. You can\u2019t afford it. With insurance, taxation, maintenance and repairs. A car is often much more expensive than you might first anticipate it to be. <\/p>\n\n<p>Following this rule of thumb should leave you with a decent financial buffer. And can spare you from a lot of car and money related headaches in the future.<\/p>\n<\/div>","1":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: Southern California<\/p>\n\n<p>Price range: $18-27k<\/p>\n\n<p>Lease or Buy: Buy preferably but leasing wouldn&#39;t be a problem<\/p>\n\n<p>New or used:\n Either<\/p>\n\n<p>Type of vehicle: Sedan, Coupe, Hatchback.

So I&#39;m looking for a car with a relatively large amount of storage space for the baby&#39;s stroller etc, with relatively low maintenance costs, for below \u20ac10.000 (second hand). My dad suggested Japanese cars such as a Toyota Avensis or Mazda 6, and he later also mentioned the Honda Jazz though I&#39;m not sure if it has enough storage space.
