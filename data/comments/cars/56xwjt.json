I hear you cringing. Naiive decision and it is a piece of trash. It has had strange acceleration, stuttering, juttering\/jolting, issues since I got it. The clutch has been replaced twice, and the entire transmission once. Rear door has been recalled once. The first 2 and then 3 years it was under warranty and extended warranty. Now it is not and has just started acting up again and I want to dump the thing before it keels over and I have to foot the bill for it. It needs new tires as well and just barely passed inspection because of it. That $500 I could use as a downpayment on a new car.<\/p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t know much about cars at all. I don&#39;t have any friends to ask for advice and originally bought it out of necessity and &quot;awe&quot; (It is a pretty cool-looking car) and feel completely ripped off. Now I have all of you fine folks on Reddit to ask for help so I don&#39;t end up making the same mistake. I heard that November\/December is the best time to buy a used car and I&#39;m probably looking at a new-er used car such as a 2013 -2016 but obviously open to your suggestions.<\/p>\n\n<p>So here is my info and I really hope someone can guide me.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>What I do like about the Fiesta:<\/strong>  I do like the way it drives. The turning is kind of fun I can make really tight onramp curves without slowing down. It feels like while driving that it is kind of &quot;tight&quot; steering and I like that. It&#39;s fairly quiet but I can rev it if I press hard on the gas and I love the exterior and color midnight blue metallic. Also love that I can stick a USB stick in it and play songs via voice command. The interior lights are really cool although not very bright.<\/li>\n<li><strong>What I don&#39;t like about Fiesta:<\/strong> Slow and lackluster. Whether its the 120hp or the bad transmission etc it just seems SLOW to accelerate at stoplights\/signs. It lacks things I would expect such as automatic headlights or a push to start or remote start keyfob. It doesn&#39;t have a way of opening the trunk from inside the car. And the multimedia display is small and all in red, no color. There&#39;s no lock hardware so I can only open the driver&#39;s door or use the keyfob.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p><strong>Following is from the template:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Location<\/strong>: Buffalo, NY (Snow-country!)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Price range<\/strong>: Max: ?, I&#39;m more concerned with what the payment will be. I can make a $250 payment each month absolute max. I&#39;ll put 3k down and have another 3k-ish from my trade-in. So let&#39;s say 30k is an absolute maximum. <\/li>\n<li><strong>New or used<\/strong>: Used, or &quot;certified pre-owned&quot;<\/li>\n<li><strong>Type of vehicle<\/strong>: Small Car, Medium-Sedan, Hatch, not opposed to anything else but I have a 1.5 car garage that can&#39;t fit big trucks in it. I prefer small cars because I can rape parking pretty much anywhere which is a necessity here in Buffalo. However, I&#39;m sure I&#39;d get used to an SUV and when driving a Lexus SUV I didn&#39;t have much trouble.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Must haves<\/strong>: At least 33mpg, a way to play music from a USB stick, bluetooth, moonroof.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Nice to haves<\/strong>: Android Auto, voicecommands, touch screen, heated seats, big trunk, I would really like a backup camera since my only accident has been when I backed out a driveway on a narrow street and hit a parked car that was parked literally right behind me on the other side of the street<\/li>\n<li><strong>Intended use<\/strong>: Daily Driver, Family Car<\/li>\n<li><strong>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered<\/strong>: I have only been able to compare it to a few other cars. An &#39;06? Prizm which handled about the same but noticeably worse, and the &#39;12 Chevy Impala which I do not like as far as driving goes (seems like steering a boat). I recently drove a Lexus RX300 not for a very long way but it was really nice to drive in the way it handled. I drove a Cadillac SRX and it seemed uneventful other than the fact that I liked being in a big vehicle. It was my then-bosses car so I was overly worried about crashing it the whole time too. \nI was looking at the 2016 Mazda 3 or 6 GT but am pretty overwhelmed overall with the variety of makes\/models. I had brand loyalty to Ford and &quot;American-Made&quot; but I don&#39;t really care so much anymore. Ford is basically made in Mexico now and my family has driven Chevys which handle noticeably worse (IMO) than my Ford.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Is this your 1st vehicle<\/strong>: No<\/li>\n<li><strong>Does the vehicle need to have a warranty<\/strong>: Yes<\/li>\n<li><strong>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle<\/strong>: Not really. I can top-off oil in, add windshield fluid, and wash it. I could probably do an oil change but it would be a stretch. I&#39;m a horrible &quot;man&quot;<\/li>\n<li><strong>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle<\/strong>: (engine and transmission rebuild, timing belt\/chains, body work etc ) HAHHAHAHA. No.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p><strong>Additional Notes<\/strong>: \nI&#39;m still single at 28 (holla ladies! -_-;) and I&#39;m looking for something that is not a grandma\/grandpa car if that makes any sense. I&#39;m not looking to pull-up in a Ferrari for 30k but I don&#39;t want to be toting a Kia Soul econo-box either. (No offense to Kia Soul!) I don&#39;t have much brand loyalty. I like Ford but literally cannot find a car model to suit me other than Focus which has the rep of the &quot;econo-box&quot;.<\/p>\n\n<p>I equate (possibly incorrectly) that better hp means better acceleration and better car.
