With a kid on the way I&#39;ve eliminated all 2-seaters or even 2-door coupes with back seats that I had been considering, so at this point I&#39;m really just considering hot hatches, or a WRX. I test drove one the other day and I like it quite a bit\u2026 the HP is definitely compelling, especially coming from my 184hp Mazda3\u2026 there are also a lot of things I could do to customize it to my own liking. Obviously it doesn&#39;t have a hatch, but other than that it&#39;s hard to find anything I don&#39;t really like about it (well, their color options aren&#39;t so great, but that&#39;s not a huge deal)<\/p>\n\n<p>I would really like to test drive a Golf R, but the new ones aren&#39;t out yet, and no one really seems to know when they will be. I can&#39;t even find a &#39;17 to try. So, I can wait for one, but if they try pulling that &quot;upcharge over sticker price&quot; nonsense I&#39;m gonna be PISSED. I refuse to do this out of principle - I find the whole notion pretty ridiculous. If it&#39;s worth more than sticker, than raise the GD sticker price.   <\/p>\n\n<p>The only other thing I&#39;m really considering is a Focus RS. I&#39;m more interested in a &#39;17 cause I don&#39;t like the new &#39;18 colors, and the dealers near me have a ton of &#39;17&#39;s that are discounted <em>slightly<\/em>. This is less practical because of the MPG, and it&#39;s also at the absolute top of the HP range\u2026 I&#39;d be going from 184 to 350 (!!!). I dunno, it might be a bit too much. I think I also read there were some issues with the RS in the first year, but hopefully those are resolved now. <\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m open to a GTI or an ST, but obviously they&#39;re not AWD which is pretty high up on my list. I did test drive an ST a few years back and it was pretty fun, and the prices on them are good. That said, the WRX is just a bit more in price and then I&#39;d have AWD and more HP, at the sacrifice of the hatchback. <\/p>\n<\/div>","77":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: (Specify your country or region)\nChicago, IL<\/p>\n\n<p>Price range: (Minimum-Maximum in your local currency)\n7-15k$<\/p>\n\n<p>Lease or Buy:\nBuy<\/p>\n\n<p>New or used:\nUsed<\/p>\n\n<p>Type of vehicle: (Truck, Car, Sports Car, Sedan, Crossover, SUV, Racecar, Luxury etc.)\nCar, preferably not stupid looking.<\/p>\n\n<p>Must haves: (4x4, AWD, Fuel efficient, Navigation, Turbo, V8, V6, Trunk space, Smooth ride, Leather etc.)\nAWD<\/p>\n\n<p>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc):\nDoesn&#39;t matter<\/p>\n\n<p>Intended use: (Daily Driver, Family Car, Weekend Car, Track Toy, Project Car, Work Truck, Off roading etc.)\nDaily driver\/Project Car<\/p>\n\n<p>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered:\n2007-2012 Ford Mustang, Camry, Accord<\/p>\n\n<p>Is this your 1st vehicle:\nYes<\/p>\n\n<p>Do you need a Warranty:\nNo<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle: (fluids, alternator, battery, brake pads etc)\nYes<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle: (engine and transmission, timing belt\/chains, body work, suspension etc )\nNot for the first year, at least, but maybe later as I get more familiar with the car.<\/p>\n\n<p>Additional Notes: Reliability for ~4 years of Chicago winters needed.<\/p>\n<\/div>","78":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: Asheville, North Carolina (Closest big city is Charlotte).<\/p>\n\n<p>Price range: $25k or less.<\/p>\n\n<p>Lease or Buy: Buy.<\/p>\n\n<p>New or used: Either.<\/p>\n\n<p>Type of vehicle: Anything that is not an SUV or a truck, I want something that handles well.<\/p>\n\n<p>Must haves: I have driven naturally aspirated 4-cylinders my whole life.
