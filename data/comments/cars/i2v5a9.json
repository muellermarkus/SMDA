I recently took a new job that will have a commute of 60 miles a day (30 there \/ 30 back). In the Maryland, DC, Virginia area this means close to an hour on the road each day so having something comfortable for someone my size (6&#39;4 \/ 200) is also a consideration. My biggest consideration is having a daily driver that I won&#39;t hate myself every morning and evening. <\/p>\n\n<p>An additional consideration is that I hope to build a homestead on the Virginia\/WV border in the coming year and expect to have an unpaved driveway and about 100 acres of property that I will have to traverse. I recently drove a Nissan Frontier for a week (600 miles) which included highways and severe off-roading. The off-roading capabilities were incredibly surprising as my expectations were low, and the pickup was not bad at all going up hills on the highway. My one complaint was that after about 4 hours on the highway my rear end became sore from the less than plush seats. <\/p>\n\n<p>I need advice as to whether it <strong>makes sense to get a fuel efficient car and just buy a second-hand truck, or if I am going to be investing in a long term vehicle does it make sense to splurge and get something like the TRD Pro<\/strong> which I won&#39;t hate driving every day and that has the capabilities for my plans as well as my hobbies (off-roading, lumber hauls from Home Depot, carrying dogs, etc.)<\/p>\n<\/div>","35":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: California, USA<\/p>\n\n<p>Price range: <strong>15-25k USD<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Lease or Buy: Buy<\/p>\n\n<p>New or used: Used<\/p>\n\n<p>Type of vehicle: Sports Car or Sedan (RWD preferred)<\/p>\n\n<p>Must haves: <strong>Manual transmission<\/strong>, fun to drive, decent reliability<\/p>\n\n<p>Desired transmission: manual<\/p>\n\n<p>Intended use: Daily Driver<\/p>\n\n<p>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: C5 Corvette Z06, 987 Boxster S \/ Cayman S, Nissan 370Z, Mustang GT, Toyota 86\/Subaru BRZ <\/p>\n\n<p>Is this your 1st vehicle: No <\/p>\n\n<p>Do you need a Warranty: No <\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle: yes<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle: no<\/p>\n\n<p>Additional Notes: The only one of these I&#39;ve actually driven before is the BRZ, which I thought was just a tad slow but not anything to complain about.

I like the crosstrek, but it could ride better (sorta loosey goosey imo), be quieter (cvt + loud road noise in cabin = eeeeekkk my ears!), and the space with seats folded down isn\u2019t roomy enough for my dog and myself to sleep back there comfortably (for sleeping in the car at a trailhead to get an early start in the morning). I need a car that I can take on adventures that can handle rough rocky roads to get to trails, that can also fit 4-5 adults comfortably for a road trip. \nI\u2019m not opposed to older vehicles or something with some mileage on it, as long as it\u2019s under 90k miles and is reliable. If this were the case, I\u2019d throw a CarPlay radio in there ASAP and probably some sound dampening, as well as get it looking nice and clean again, inside and out.

About 46,000 miles in very, very good condition (minor scratch on rear bumper and could be a little cleaner inside). Extended warranty lasts until February 2021. Grey, with Harman Kardon speakers (I didn&#39;t expect to notice a difference, but boy was I wrong). Also has the ring below the shifter that you can use to select sport, mid, or green\/eco (forget the actual name), which I like. Owner took very good care of the car and did all scheduled maintenance at the dealership. $13,000.<\/p>\n\n<p>Second, a <a href=\"https:\/\/imgur.com\/L5lydlC\">2017 Mini Cooper<\/a>, certified pre-owned directly from the same dealership mentioned above. About 30,000 miles in excellent condition. &quot;New vehicle limited warranty&quot; lasts until 5\/27\/2021, &quot;certified pre-owned protection plan&quot; lasts until 5\/27\/2022 (not sure if this the same as an &quot;extended&quot; warranty). Pepper white (which my wife prefers), white turn signals, and LED headlights. Does NOT have Harman Kardon speakers or mode select ring I noted above. About $16,000 from dealership (possibly a little more or less...squishy price).<\/p>\n\n<p>Overall I consider these cars to be in essentially the same condition given that all maintenance on the first was done at the dealership and it was also a certified pre-owned car prior to the current owner. I also think the features for the first (speakers, mode select) vs. the features for the second (color, LED lights) basically wash out. I lean a little more toward the first car, while my wife leans a little more toward the second.<\/p>\n\n<p>So the decision really comes down to the value of the longer warranty and the 16,000 lower mileage for the second car. It worth the extra $3k-ish? I don&#39;t really know how to assign a value to the warranty. Or maybe I&#39;m not thinking about the other pros\/cons correctly.<\/p>\n\n<p>What do you guys think?<\/p>\n\n<p>P.S.: if you assign no value to the warranty or the other differences between the cars besides the mileage, those 16,000 fewer miles would cost me $0.1875 per mile. My gut tells me that&#39;s reasonable, but I don&#39;t have anything to compare it to.<\/p>\n<\/div>","57":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: Edmonton AB Canada<\/p>\n\n<p>Price range: $30-$80k<\/p>\n\n<p>Lease or Buy: either <\/p>\n\n<p>New or used: prefer new<\/p>\n\n<p>Type of vehicle: SUV, Crossover, truck<\/p>\n\n<p>Must haves: AWD, performance, ground clearance, saves seat settings<\/p>\n\n<p>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc): Automatic<\/p>\n\n<p>Intended use: Daily Driver, all weather, road trip.
