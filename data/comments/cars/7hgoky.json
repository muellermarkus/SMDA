We&#39;re thinking about buying a new car, which would be a first for both of us. We&#39;ve test driven a Transit Connect Wagon and like it. It seems a bit tricky to find them in passenger configuration though. In the interest of cross shopping, I&#39;ve been looking for other wagons. The Golf Alltrack looks interesting. I like that (in theory, according to VW) we can get the trim level that has leather and a big sunroof while still retaining the manual transmission. Subaru makes a few different wagons, but I&#39;m not so familiar with their line up, and it looks like everything has a CVT unless you buy a stripped down base model with an anemic 2.0i. Please correct me if I&#39;m wrong. Does anyone else make a decent wagon\/wagovan type car under $30k? I would love to hear other suggestions.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Additional question related to buying new-- The car company websites all have build &amp; price tools. Can we configure a car on the website, make a print out, take it to a dealer, and ask them to get that specific configuration?

Any info would be fantastic I&#39;ve done as much research as I can but I&#39;m still so conflicted if I should even consider selling the Focus at 140k miles and just stick with it for the rest of the time.

My weekend car is a 2014 370z that is modified and is only driven when it is nice out. I&#39;m looking for a daily driver that is a blast to drive, and I can beat the crap out of without the risk of getting arrested. I can only drive my Z 10\/10 on a track because the low torque\/high hp means it really only puts a smile on my face when you start doing speeds that will put you in jail. I&#39;ve been considering a GTi because of all of the dealer rebates on the 2017 models (I can get a 2017 base model for around 20k-21k). I also found a very reputable dealer that is a a 3hr drive from home that has a 2016 Fiesta St with 25k miles on it for $15k. It is fully loaded with red recaros, and it is actually the same exact color as my Z which is pretty cool. So, what would you do? $15k for a used Fiesta St, or spend 6k more for a new GTi?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>","23":"<div class=\"md\"><ul>\n<li>Northern Ontario, Canada.

Hatchbacks are a bonus. <\/li>\n<li>Intended use: Daily Driver - kids to daycare and me to work 95% of the time. 5% when I can escape the tedium of real life and wreck some backroad highways along the beauty of Lake Superior while sucking back lattes and listening to the engine scream as I remind it that it can rev above 2600rpm. \n*Vehicles I&#39;ve already considered: Off the top of my head my &quot;Honey, I&#39;m going out to test drive stuff&quot; list would be something like:  Honda Civic, Mazda 3, VW Golf, Fiesta ST (Can I fit two front-facing car seats in it without cutting my legs off?). There&#39;s no Subaru dealership locally otherwise a WRX (without the giant wings. Sorry.) would be on the list since 4 months a year we&#39;re buried in lake-effect snow.<\/li>\n<li>Is this Your First Vehicle: No. Currently driving a 2014 Mazda 6. It&#39;s an automatic and as engaging as the Mazdas can be, driving a 3200lb midsize sedan with a 4cyl and an auto is still boring. Great car though. (and to be fair, 3200 is still light for it&#39;s size and it feels much lighter. But the road noise.....ugh.)\n*additional notes: I&#39;m a government shlub with a boring life who wants to enjoy my commuting and running about more. I want revvy, precise, fun manual transmission engagement. However, I don&#39;t want to discredit the importance of reliability. I&#39;m part teenage hooligan part grumpy old man. I&#39;ll drive a Civic SI or a tacoma and be happy in either. However I have little interest in the grey areas in between. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>There are a number of cars I&#39;m sure satisfy this interest. The &quot;I want a Miata but have kids&quot; problem basically. There are things I like and dislike about the list. <\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Honda Civic - the new 1.5 turbo kind of freaks me out. That&#39;s a very small engine. How hard does that turbo have to be working to get 174hp out of something so small? The rear-end design of the car is also a little too hyper-futuristic but the rest of the car, including the interior I like. Also, where&#39;s the SI?<\/li>\n<li>Mazda 3 - Already being a mazda owner I love the obvious driver-centric engineering. The road feel and steering feel is top notch. However the comprimises to achieve that I don&#39;t hear much of until I bought the car. The road noise is brutal. The car feels like it&#39;s made of paper and even with winter tires, it&#39;s unusually poor to drive in the winter. (My old Sunfire was a far better winter driver than this car is.) I fear those comprimises, if are to the same degree on the 3 as they are on my 6 would turn me off or drive me nuts in the long run. But a smaller version of my car but with the same engine (power to weight ratio baby!) and a manual gearbox would be so nice. Mazda&#39;s 2.5L is such a butter-smooth engine. I really like it. <\/li>\n<li>VW Golf - The GTI baseline starts at $31k, which to me is a lot for a compact car. I like the minimalist designs of the golfs in general. I&#39;m not sure how agile or engaging they are to drive though. I know little about owning german cars - no idea what I&#39;d be getting into. <\/li>\n<li>Ford Fiesta ST - This is the kind of car designed for me but if I had my income now ten years ago. Too bad. I don&#39;t think I&#39;d be comfortable in something of this size with a couple kids but it&#39;s worth trying anyway. Reliability freaks me out - I&#39;ve had some issues with Ford ownership in the past and the local dealership on top of it is a bit skeezy. But damn, the Fiesta ST is a wicked little car. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>I can&#39;t think of other examples at the moment. Maybe you can?

I was in my first accident (30) and I totaled my 2013 Mazda3 like an idiot. I\u2019m super mad at myself, but anyway I\u2019m looking for another car. I want it to be reliable and safe. Now, because the accident was my fault, I have lost confidence in my driving and decisions. My Mazda was a base model with none of the advance safety features that are out today. I\u2019m wondering if I should make these new features a priority to help me. Most cars I can afford do not have these except a used 2017 Toyota Corolla, where collision warnings are standard. \nI liked my Mazda3, even though it had no features it drove nice. Then again, coming from my awful Malibu anything would have been better. Other cars that have received a lot of praise would be a Honda Civic, Honda Fit and the Mazda3, but these would need to be an older model to stay in my price range. I guess my question is to all of you, how important\/life saving is this new technology to put it above other categories? How should it rank? The Mazda3 would have a blind spot warning, but not forward collision for example. \nThanks for reading this. I know I\u2019m basically going from no options to at least a back up camera but again I\u2019m not sure what to prioritize.\nMy boyfriend is no help, he wants me to get an s2000 but I know my insurance would go through the roof.

I haven&#39;t gotten to test drive the GS 350 or S4 yet, but the 350 interior doesn&#39;t really impress  me too much. The S4 is my current favorite of these cars, so I&#39;m looking to see if anyone has any other recommendations similar to it. I&#39;ve looked at a C43 AMG, but that starts getting a little out of my price range with some options added on, and I&#39;m not really a fan of BMWs.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>I&#39;d also be getting the car in January\/February, if that makes a difference from the dealer&#39;s perspective.

I was initially looking for a pickup, but given my price range, it&#39;s extremely hard to find a nice truck that isn&#39;t old or beaten to hell.

This will be the first car I buy myself; in high school I drove a plain old 09 Mazda 3 with the 4 speed autothat my parents got for REALLY cheap. I was never happy with the way the car drove on the highway and when the time came for either myself or my sister to keep the car for good, I let her take it, allowing me to get the car I really want some day. <\/p>\n\n<p>Do you think its a bad idea to get a manual as my first car? The fuel economy, more control over the performance, theft deterrence, and let&#39;s be honest, the cool factor are all drawing me towards it. Surprisingly, my father agrees and thinks a manual would add a lot of fun to an otherwise plain car. <\/p>\n\n<p>TLDR: first car is either gonna be a Focus hatchback or a Mazda3 hatch.
