I also really like the focus rs but its a bit more expensive to buy as the 2017s. i can find it just alittle over 35k used, and im worried about the 2016s head gasket issue. Although the rs is way more track ready stock. Also inconsistencies with the power delivery by some worry me about the rs. Although my current vehicle is a 2004 honda pilot so im sure it will always feel fast for me by comparison. Also any thing else to consider.
