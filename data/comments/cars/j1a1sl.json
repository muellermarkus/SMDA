My gf wants a car since we already have a truck but wants to be able to use our hitch bike rack. Our driveway has a decent size dip at the end of it and some bike lots are a bit dippy. Worried about a bolt on hitch bottoming out. Wondering if anyone still does factory hitches for cars (I&#39;m assuming those will go through the bumper and be a few inches higher). Another issue is that she had two bad experiences with Subaru so those are out and are the most likely to still have it lol (and AWD). Anyways curious about suggestions, might have to settle for a small SUV.

For anyone who owns a car from the period, how reliable are they now after 20 years, and about how much might I have to pay for common repairs at this point on average? If the cost isn&#39;t too high, or if they are just about as reliable as newer cars, I might be able to make a case for me to get such a car.

Also will be taking some long trips to rural Maine to see family and hitting the slopes.   <\/p>\n\n<p>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: Honda Element, Honda CR-V, Toyota Rav4, Toyota Venza, Kia Sportage, Kia Sorrento, Hyundai Tucson, Hyundai Santa Fe, Subaru Forester, Volkswagen Tiguan, Mazda CX-5, Mitsubishi Outlander.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Is this your 1st vehicle:No.  Would be the first one that I&#39;ve bought myself.<\/p>\n\n<p>Do you need a Warranty:No.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle: (fluids, alternator, battery, brake pads etc) Yes.   <\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle: (engine and transmission, timing belt\/chains, body work, suspension etc ) Nope.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Additional Notes: I&#39;ve got quite a list of cars that I&#39;m looking at there, but I&#39;m really not sure which ones should be at the top of my list and which ones I maybe shouldn&#39;t be looking at. I&#39;m not sure that a lease is a good idea for me since my mileage is going to go way up in the winter versus any other season. I&#39;ve mentioned this several times but performance in the snow is extremely important, that access road to Bolton Valley in Vermont is sketchy as hell if it&#39;s just snowed, and the roads up near Carrabassett Valley Maine can also get pretty rough. I can&#39;t let that keep me from enjoying a powder day though.<\/p>\n<\/div>","37":"<div class=\"md\"><p><strong>Location<\/strong>: California, USA<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Price range<\/strong>: ~$25k or less<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Lease or Buy<\/strong>: Buy<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>New or used<\/strong>: New<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Type of vehicle<\/strong>: 4-door compact or mid-sized sedan, preferably Toyota<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Must haves<\/strong>: Reliability, ease and affordability of repair, long life (I will drive until the wheels fall off).<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Desired transmission<\/strong>: Automatic, but <em>absolutely no belted CVTs<\/em> (eCVTs such as Toyota Hybrids okay)<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Intended use<\/strong>: Daily driving\/commuting and hopefully eventually family car<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered<\/strong>: Currently trying to decide between 2020 Camry LE (gas) and 2021 Corolla Hybrid LE.

Its a relatively small car but the drivers seat is adjustable and I have no problem fitting being 6&#39;2&quot;. The engine is an I4 turbo so you get decent fuel economy and a solid 228 horsepower paired with AWD (quattro) It may not be a sports car but its based off the golf, and the reliability certain holds up to those standards. I picked one up with 5k miles for an outstanding price but I recently totaled it in a rock slide :\/ wasn&#39;t hurt beyond a couple scrapes, very safe car as well.<\/p>\n<\/div>","68":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I have a 2012 camaro ss with full bolt ons and tune. I love my car but I&#39;m getting tired of the lack of practicality, body jolting from every manual shift. I want a fast car so I would get the giulia and get a piggyback tune. I see members are getting in the higher 4&#39;s for 0-60 and that would be like what my camaro was stock. So even though it&#39;s a bit slower it still would do for me.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Then I was searching alternatives. Audi s4 is great but a little bit too expensive, more than I&#39;d like to spend on a car. But what has comparable price used is a BMW 340i x drive with m sport package.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Without being too biased which would you go for? I think the 340 might be the better performer but the giulia is definitely seen less often, atleast where I live which gives it a point.<\/p>\n<\/div>","69":"<div class=\"md\"><p>My house is 22 miles from my work place. Its a highway drive. So I will be most probably driving atleast 175 miles a week. That comes to atleast 9100 miles an year. But that is on the lower side. I will probably reach 12000 easily.<\/p>\n\n<p>My main worry is car maintenance costs. I have been recently hit with excessive maintenance costs on my current car and Frankly scared. I will be driving 10000 miles per year. <\/p>\n\n<p>I am looking for the cheapest possible car.<\/p>\n\n<p>Questions :<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>I know a used car is always cheaper. If i buy a used car, i will buy a toyota or a honda. However. My main worry is driving so many miles each year, will I be looking at a huge maintenance costs even for a Toyota or corolla? That&#39;s my main issue with secondhand cars. (if i buy a used car i will buy one that&#39;s 2\/3 years old to escape the initial depreciation cost) so I probably will not have bumper to bumper warranty.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>If my maintenance  worries are actually valid and true, I guess getting a new car is the best because I then will have bumper to bumper warranty. Now if I get a new car, I guess I don&#39;t need to worry to much about the make and model (apart from depreciation costs). Now for a new car I again have two choices. Lease and finance.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>If I lease, all i am looking for is a good lease deal that gives me the lowest total payment in the lease term. I can probably get a nissan sentra or hyundai accent, whatever gives me the cheapest overall lease cost during the 36 month period.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>If i finance, I do need to think about the depreciation cost and again here, toyota or Honda will make the most sense. Plus here, I don&#39;t need to worry about miles also a lot because most probably I will be covered bumper to bumper till 36000 miles and 3 years<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>So considering all these factors, can you please tell me which one makes most sense?? Which one will be the best for me considering the situation and financially?? Am I over worried about maintainence issues??<\/p>\n\n<p>I currently own a chevrolet spark and am horrified with problems.<\/p>\n<\/div>","70":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[gel\u00f6scht]<\/p>\n<\/div>","71":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: Durango Colorado <\/p>\n\n<p>Price: under ~12k hopefully <\/p>\n\n<p>Buy, used<\/p>\n\n<p>Type: Don\u2019t care, but mileage matters a lot to me<\/p>\n\n<p>Must haves: 4x4, or AWD but I\u2019m not sure if I really need it?<\/p>\n\n<p>Transmission: Don\u2019t care<\/p>\n\n<p>Use: Daily commuter, family car, groceries <\/p>\n\n<p>Vehicles I\u2019m considering: any type of subaru, toyota pickup, or any type of toyota or honda sedan with all weather tires. <\/p>\n\n<p>2nd vehicle<\/p>\n\n<p>No warranty<\/p>\n\n<p>Minor repairs <\/p>\n\n<p>Notes: I currently own a 2000 Toyota corolla.

podium;<\/p>\n<\/div>"},"comment_toplevel":{"0":1,"1":1,"2":1,"3":1,"4":1,"5":1,"6":1,"7":1,"8":1,"9":1,"10":1,"11":1,"12":1,"13":1,"14":1,"15":1,"16":1,"17":1,"18":1,"19":1,"20":1,"21":1,"22":1,"23":1,"24":1,"25":1,"26":1,"27":1,"28":1,"29":1,"30":1,"31":1,"32":1,"33":1,"34":1,"35":1,"36":1,"37":1,"38":1,"39":1,"40":1,"41":1,"42":1,"43":1,"44":1,"45":1,"46":1,"47":1,"48":1,"49":1,"50":1,"51":1,"52":1,"53":1,"54":1,"55":1,"56":1,"57":1,"58":1,"59":1,"60":1,"61":1,"62":1,"63":1,"64":1,"65":1,"66":1,"67":1,"68":1,"69":1,"70":1,"71":1,"72":1,"73":1,"74":1,"75":1,"76":1,"77":1,"78":1,"79":1,"80":1,"81":1,"82":1,"83":1,"84":1,"85":1,"86":1,"87":1,"88":1},"comment_distinguished":{"0":null,"1":null,"2":null,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null,"7":null,"8":null,"9":null,"10":null,"11":null,"12":null,"13":null,"14":null,"15":null,"16":null,"17":null,"18":null,"19":null,"20":null,"21":null,"22":null,"23":null,"24":null,"25":null,"26":null,"27":null,"28":null,"29":null,"30":null,"31":null,"32":null,"33":null,"34":null,"35":null,"36":null,"37":null,"38":null,"39":null,"40":null,"41":null,"42":null,"43":null,"44":null,"45":null,"46":null,"47":null,"48":null,"49":null,"50":null,"51":null,"52":null,"53":null,"54":null,"55":null,"56":null,"57":null,"58":null,"59":null,"60":null,"61":null,"62":null,"63":null,"64":null,"65":null,"66":null,"67":null,"68":null,"69":null,"70":null,"71":null,"72":null,"73":null,"74":null,"75":null,"76":null,"77":null,"78":null,"79":null,"80":null,"81":null,"82":null,"83":null,"84":null,"85":null,"86":null,"87":null,"88":null},"comment_edited":{"0":1601297222.0,"1":false,"2":false,"3":false,"4":false,"5":false,"6":false,"7":false,"8":false,"9":false,"10":false,"11":1601397174.0,"12":false,"13":false,"14":false,"15":false,"16":false,"17":false,"18":false,"19":false,"20":false,"21":false,"22":false,"23":1601689887.0,"24":false,"25":false,"26":1601730456.0,"27":false,"28":false,"29":false,"30":1601297139.0,"31":false,"32":false,"33":false,"34":false,"35":false,"36":1601328002.0,"37":1601331105.0,"38":false,"39":false,"40":false,"41":false,"42":false,"43":false,"44":false,"45":false,"46":false,"47":false,"48":false,"49":false,"50":false,"51":1601524365.0,"52":false,"53":false,"54":1601639736.0,"55":false,"56":false,"57":false,"58":false,"59":false,"60":false,"61":false,"62":false,"63":false,"64":false,"65":false,"66":false,"67":false,"68":false,"69":false,"70":1601731363.0,"71":false,"72":false,"73":false,"74":false,"75":false,"76":1601816657.0,"77":false,"78":false,"79":false,"80":false,"81":false,"82":1601384979.0,"83":false,"84":1601331967.0,"85":false,"86":false,"87":false,"88":false},"comment_is_submitter":{"0":false,"1":false,"2":false,"3":false,"4":false,"5":false,"6":false,"7":false,"8":false,"9":false,"10":false,"11":false,"12":false,"13":false,"14":false,"15":false,"16":false,"17":false,"18":false,"19":false,"20":false,"21":false,"22":false,"23":false,"24":false,"25":false,"26":false,"27":false,"28":false,"29":false,"30":false,"31":false,"32":false,"33":false,"34":false,"35":false,"36":false,"37":false,"38":false,"39":false,"40":false,"41":false,"42":false,"43":false,"44":false,"45":false,"46":false,"47":false,"48":false,"49":false,"50":false,"51":false,"52":false,"53":false,"54":false,"55":false,"56":false,"57":false,"58":false,"59":false,"60":false,"61":false,"62":false,"63":false,"64":false,"65":false,"66":false,"67":false,"68":false,"69":false,"70":false,"71":false,"72":false,"73":false,"74":false,"75":false,"76":false,"77":false,"78":false,"79":false,"80":false,"81":false,"82":false,"83":false,"84":false,"85":false,"86":false,"87":false,"88":false},"comment_score":{"0":3,"1":3,"2":3,"3":3,"4":3,"5":2,"6":2,"7":2,"8":2,"9":2,"10":2,"11":2,"12":2,"13":2,"14":2,"15":2,"16":2,"17":2,"18":2,"19":2,"20":2,"21":2,"22":2,"23":2,"24":2,"25":2,"26":2,"27":2,"28":2,"29":2,"30":1,"31":1,"32":1,"33":1,"34":1,"35":1,"36":1,"37":1,"38":1,"39":1,"40":1,"41":1,"42":1,"43":1,"44":1,"45":1,"46":1,"47":1,"48":1,"49":1,"50":1,"51":1,"52":1,"53":1,"54":1,"55":1,"56":1,"57":1,"58":1,"59":1,"60":1,"61":1,"62":1,"63":1,"64":1,"65":1,"66":1,"67":1,"68":1,"69":1,"70":1,"71":1,"72":1,"73":1,"74":1,"75":1,"76":1,"77":1,"78":1,"79":1,"80":1,"81":1,"82":1,"83":1,"84":0,"85":0,"86":0,"87":0,"88":-1},"comment_stickied":{"0":false,"1":false,"2":false,"3":false,"4":false,"5":false,"6":false,"7":false,"8":false,"9":false,"10":false,"11":false,"12":false,"13":false,"14":false,"15":false,"16":false,"17":false,"18":false,"19":false,"20":false,"21":false,"22":false,"23":false,"24":false,"25":false,"26":false,"27":false,"28":false,"29":false,"30":false,"31":false,"32":false,"33":false,"34":false,"35":false,"36":false,"37":false,"38":false,"39":false,"40":false,"41":false,"42":false,"43":false,"44":false,"45":false,"46":false,"47":false,"48":false,"49":false,"50":false,"51":false,"52":false,"53":false,"54":false,"55":false,"56":false,"57":false,"58":false,"59":false,"60":false,"61":false,"62":false,"63":false,"64":false,"65":f
