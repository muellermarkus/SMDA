(We have 2 little kids, she&#39;s tried to learn to drive it but we don&#39;t have a lot of time for lessons.) Plus I am just kind of ready for something a little smoother, more refined, but still quick.<\/p>\n\n<p>I really really like the new Mercedes C43 AMG (better interior than the BMW, and oh that exhaust sound) but that is not going to happen in my price range. I was thinking about leasing a new 340i, but all the great BMW lease deals have dried up lately -- MF is going up, they&#39;ve gotten rid of MSDs, etc. From my perusing of LeaseHackr and the like, it doesn&#39;t sound like I&#39;m going to get a 340i for $450\/mo lease with 0 down (I have a mental block about paying much more than $400\/mo for a car...$450\/mo is already pushing it. I can, I just...don&#39;t want to). I drove a 2017 340i and loved it, but haven&#39;t driven the older 2012-2015 335i yet. From what I&#39;ve read, though, the newer engine in the 340i seems like a pretty solid improvement over the 335i and virtually eliminates turbo lag while making more power. Plus it supposedly has better steering feel.<\/p>\n\n<p>So I&#39;m leaning toward a used\/CPO 2016 340i with M-Sport package, which I can find in the low-mid $40ks, and even a few in the high $30ks. That might be a bit more than a low-$30ks F30 335i with not too much mileage, but it&#39;s way better than the $55k for a new 340i specced the way I want.<\/p>\n\n<p>As for the others...I don&#39;t really like the way the Infinitis look, inside or outside, and I&#39;m just not sure about Audi&#39;s quality. Plus for some weird reason the S4 holds its value a lot better than the 335i\/340i; $40k at best gets me a 2014 S4, usually with upwards of 20k miles, whereas I can easily find 2015\/2016 BMWs with 20k miles or less for the same price.<\/p>\n\n<p>Am I missing something?
