It was instantly comfortable to me, really quiet interior, good engine (nothing like a turbo though), and I LOVE the HUD projected on the windshield. And if I&#39;m going to be dropping this kind of cash on a car I want it to look good too. Cons: Smaller end of cargo space in the class and a sorta dated infotainment.<\/li>\n<li>VW Alltrack - Good space, engine, ground clearance, comfort, infotainment, moonroof. Pretty much a good all rounder. Cons: VWs seem hit or miss on reliability. You either get a tank or a lemon. Cons: Not as good handling as the CX-5, lower to the ground, bit more claustrophobic.<\/li>\n<li>Subaru Forester: Wanted to try the XT but they didn&#39;t have one. Great view, very small A pillars. Subaru AWD, ok engine for the 2.5i and the CVT is ok. Cons: Dated interiors, new Forester being announced soon, <del>XT is more than what I want to pay<\/del> I looked at wrong model, pricing isnt bad.<\/li>\n<li>Ford Escape: Oh my that 2.0 turbo is nice. Cons: The interior was noticeably not comfortable to me.

I recently got a new job and will be commuting about 60 miles per day round trip, so I need something more fuel efficient.  Since I live in NJ, we are exposed to all sorts of weather and as you can imagine, having a Mustang in the winter can be no fun.  I am leaning strongly towards the Impreza, but the Civic has been creeping up in my mind lately due to high MPG and Honda reliability.  I would like to sell my Mustang to a third party first before getting a new car, especially since the dealer&#39;s trade in values are usually poo-poo.  My GF and I love going camping and hiking so having a Subaru just makes sense to me.  I am not married to getting a new car but my parents are being very pushy to me getting a new one with a warranty etc.  I&#39;ve only ever owned one car that reached over 100k miles and it had issues all the time (2006 Passat, but it was a 10 year old VW), otherwise I&#39;d consider getting an &#39;older&#39; car with more miles for cheaper.   I test drove a new Impreza Sport(?) and really enjoyed the ride.
