Coupe is preferable because of snow and general NJ weather, would probably be a bitch to clean snow off a soft top. I can do some work myself, I&#39;ve been learning by talking car of our 2004 4Runner and replacing things like the radiator, trans oil line, power steering lines, etc. I&#39;ve ruled out the following but you&#39;re welcome to sell me on them as well: Accord coupe, 135, 335, MB c class cars, Z3, C4 vettes<\/p>\n<\/div>","81":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Location:<\/strong> Netherlands<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Price range:<\/strong> MAX 8000 EUR  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Lease or Buy:<\/strong> Buy  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>New or used:<\/strong> Used  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Type of vehicle:<\/strong> Small and light  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Must haves:<\/strong> Some power, cheap maintenance.  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc):<\/strong> Manual  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Intended use:<\/strong> Daily get to internship car (25000km \/ year)  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered:<\/strong> Kia Picanto, Seat Mii, Suzuki Alto, Renault Twingo, Hyundai i10, Chevrolet Aveo, Opel Adam.   <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Is this your 1st vehicle:<\/strong> Yes  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you need a Warranty:<\/strong> Preferably  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> Some  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> No  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Additional Notes:<\/strong> First car, to be used to travel to my internship were I get a (slave) wage of 316 monthly.

Computers? What will I need to interface and function with them? What software?<\/p>\n\n<p>3) Finding technical specs has been hard, this one has a 4 cylinder 1.8l engine in it, weights of the engine and dimensions would be good if anyone has them please.<\/p>\n\n<p>4) Safety systems, such as airbags, are these on a standalone system or are they integrated into the body control module?<\/p>\n\n<p>5) With regards to cruise control, is this regulated on a fly by wire system, or a cable?<\/p>\n\n<p>The one I have found is very neat, looks good, high kilometres but that&#39;s irrelevant as I&#39;ll be rebuilding\/replacing basically everything that matters on high kilometre vehicles anyway.<\/p>\n\n<p>However I don&#39;t want to drop money on the car if it ends up that it&#39;s not suitable for my project, or it&#39;s going to be a colossal mess to get computers talking to each other.
