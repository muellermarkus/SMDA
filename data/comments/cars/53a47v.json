If I have an outing with friends and don&#39;t feel like driving, you can be damn sure I&#39;m going to show up in the lowered 2-seater rather than the comfortable sedan.  Sports cars are like having a get-out-of-hauling-people-around free card. :)<\/p>\n<\/div>","1":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[gel\u00f6scht]<\/p>\n<\/div>","2":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;m not even a Ford fan but I absolutely love the new Focus<\/p>\n<\/div>","3":"<div class=\"md\"><p>weird I work at a rental car place and drive Mazda 3s and Focus&#39;s every day and I don&#39;t like the Focus at all. Elise is one of my dreams cars though I would love to just sit in one. <\/p>\n<\/div>","4":"<div class=\"md\"><p>You even got the best color! Awesome choice man.<\/p>\n<\/div>","5":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Congratulations on your new DD, and I hope you enjoy it as much as I&#39;ve enjoyed mine so far.  :)<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.focusst.org\/forum\/forum.php\">FocusST.org<\/a> is a fantastic resource that has already been pretty helpful for me.<\/p>\n<\/div>","6":"<div class=\"md\"><p>11 k mi in 9 months? A lot?? Im putting 27k in my E39 in 9 months! Pfffff<\/p>\n<\/div>","7":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Good move! A fun daily driver that you also don&#39;t have anxiety about is awesome. <\/p>\n\n<p>Oh, and if you do nothing else, be sure to replace the godawful rear motor mount on the ST. <\/p>\n<\/div>","8":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;m VERY torn between a Focus ST3 and a GTI MK7 SE.<\/p>\n\n<p>The problem is finding a focus ST nearby to test drive.<\/p>\n<\/div>","9":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Good choice, and most of the reasons are why I chose the ST and over the Speed 3.<\/p>\n\n<p>You know, minus the whole &#39;Lotus Elise&#39; thing.<\/p>\n<\/div>","10":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Glad you followed through!

I&#39;m a bit confused though on the wheels, it looks like the older ST wheels: I thought the 2016 wheels were a new design? Are you planning any mods yet?<\/p>\n<\/div>","13":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Not a Focus, but I love my Fiesta.<\/p>\n\n<p>I can totally understand all your &quot;complaints&quot; about the Lotus though. Not half as cool, but DD&#39;ing a 350Z I also always hated parallel parking downtown, worrying over every dent and ding and such. It&#39;s exhausting worrying over your baby 7 days a week.<\/p>\n\n<p>Hopefully some day I&#39;ll be able to get 2 cars and have a proper weekend car, I&#39;d love a Lotus. Glad you&#39;re happy with your switch :)<\/p>\n<\/div>","14":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Wear out the Goodyears on the ST and replace with pilot Supersport s. Car is on rails. Also a Cobb stage 1 kit with the motor mount and a good program will really wake the ST up. <\/p>\n<\/div>","15":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Nice pick and great color, I&#39;m partial to Ingot Silver \/ Magnetic Grey myself, but this paint job is definitely quite something.  They refreshed the look of the Focus ST a year ago and I think it looks a lot better inside and out with just a few subtle changes (the hood line no longer curves over the Ford badge, the steering wheel has been significantly upgraded along with some interior bits, etc).<\/p>\n<\/div>","16":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Although this title is circle-jerk worthy, it&#39;s true that the fiberglass is probably one of the biggest concerns when it comes to the Lotus.<\/p>\n<\/div>","17":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Don&#39;t forget to update your flair ;-)<\/p>\n\n<p>Also, get us a picture of them side by side!<\/p>\n<\/div>","18":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Yea my elise is definitely showing some mileage on the bottom of the front clam...<\/p>\n<\/div>","19":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;m thinking of doing the exact opposite swap as I&#39;m a bit sick of my ST already... Living in SoCal having a roadster is VERY appealing as well.<\/p>\n<\/div>","20":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Wish I could afford 2 cool cars, but welcome to the ST club anyway.  Definitely a fun car with a good aftermarket and pretty friendly community.<\/p>\n<\/div>","21":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Yeah that definitely makes sense.  I think the Focus has a bit deeper cargo space but the hatch does slope more.  And I&#39;m glad it&#39;s comfortable on long drives!  I want to do some road trips but doing 4k rpm at 80 mph in a twitchy miata for hours on end is not very fun.<\/p>\n<\/div>"},"comment_toplevel":{"0":1,"1":1,"2":1,"3":1,"4":1,"5":1,"6":1,"7":1,"8":1,"9":1,"10":1,"11":1,"12":1,"13":1,"14":1,"15":1,"16":1,"17":1,"18":1,"19":1,"20":1,"21":1},"comment_distinguished":{"0":null,"1":null,"2":null,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null,"7":null,"8":null,"9":null,"10":null,"11":null,"12":null,"13":null,"14":null,"15":null,"16":null,"17":null,"18":null,"19":null,"20":null,"21":null},"comment_edited":{"0":false,"1":false,"2":false,"3":false,"4":false,"5":false,"6":false,"7":false,"8":false,"9":false,"10":false,"11":false,"12":false,"13":false,"14":false,"15":false,"16":false,"17":false,"18":false,"19":false,"20":false,"21":false},"comment_is_submitter":{"0":false,"1":false,"2":false,"3":false,"4":false,"5":false,"6":false,"7":false,"8":false,"9":false,"10":false,"11":false,"12":false,"13":false,"14":false,"15":false,"16":false,"17":false,"18":false,"19":false,"20":false,"21":false},"comment_score":{"0":140,"1":15,"2":14,"3":6,"4":3,"5":3,"6":5,"7":2,"8":2,"9":2,"10":2,"11":2,"12":2,"13":2,"14":2,"15":2,"16":1,"17":1,"18":1,"19":1,"20":1,"21":2},"comment_stickied":{"0":false,"1":false,"2":false,"3":false,"4":false,"5":false,"6":false,"7":false,"8":false,"9":false,"10":false,"11":false,"12":false,"13":false,"14":false,"15":false,"16":false,"17":false,"18":false,"19":false,"20":false,"21":false},"author_id":{"0":"apg96","1":"","2":"cgqg4","3":"","4":"","5":"f5f49","6":"qsqhy","7":"6nrgg","8":"4gyu7","9":"53o9y","10":"ab2w0","11":"9hxxt","12":"a30us","13":"7mf0w","14":"","15":"alkhp","16":"","17":"7twvt","18":"3gygb","19":"44ufz","20":"7vd3v","21":"jeoh8"},"author_name":{"0":"Alex-Gopson","1":"","2":"TheCrispyCat","3":"hypmoden","4":"","5":"MisterNoisy","6":"bourguignon7","7":"Williamfoster63","8":"PanGalacGargleBlastr","9":"coolcool23","10":"ChiengBang","11":"cottonr","12":"dajohnnyboy","13":"stakoverflo","14":"","15":"Gorgenapper","16":"","17":"molotov_sh","18":"angrytroll123","19":"whatiship","20":"Xrayruester","21":"inertial-d"}}
