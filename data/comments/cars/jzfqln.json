I need it to be very cheap, but I&#39;d also like some style. My favourite era of cars is from the eighties right up to around 1998. My favourite car is the Toyota Sprinter Trueno. Are there any cheap, reliable cars that look close to a Trueno that I could possibly get for under \u00a33000?\nI can do minor work on a vehicle and would use it simply as a daily driver, but I&#39;d also be interested in upgrading it under the hood to run on a track. I would probably want a Petrol, Manual car which is preferably 4WD or RWD. I live in the UK, so I think this&#39;ll be difficult. I also need cheap insurance. So far I&#39;ve considered a 1994 Toyota Corolla and have also looked at some &#39;90s VW Golfs, VW Jettas, Vauxhall Astras and Ford Escorts.
