I&#39;d be happy to get something new or something used with a warranty and good reliability. I liked the idea of a Jeep Wrangler because I like the idea of being able to take the top off, Which fits with my teenage-kid fantasy of driving off-road to go camping\/hiking\/climbing, etc.  But I&#39;ve been told the Jeep may not actually be as reliable or as safe as I&#39;d envisioned.<\/p>\n\n<p>I need to be able to fit all 5 of us as well as luggage for everyone for a beach trip, climbing trip, biking trip, ski trip, camping trip, etc.  I&#39;m not opposed to doing that with the help of a roof rack bullet-box type of thing. I do fully expect to need to carry 5 bikes, 5 sets of skis, etc. I think that&#39;s a combo of a roof rack and a hitch-mounted bike rack.<\/p>\n\n<p>Anyone have opinions on the VW Atlas or Hyundai Santa Fe?<\/p>\n\n<p>Any other suggestions?

Her name is Mrs. Shitbox and I love her. She&#39;s got 225k miles and has always been reliable. She&#39;s going to die someday (there&#39;s a strange ticking in the engine, it&#39;s always been there, I&#39;ve troubleshot it since 2014 I don&#39;t wanna talk about it lol) she has always started. Never once has she broken down and anytime she acts weird I investigate and fix any issues right away. She&#39;s got some weird quirks (battery terminal loose so you gotta wiggle it on cold days to get her to start, sometimes the brake lights latch on after shutdown, ECS OFF fault pops randomly, chipped windshield, specks on mirrors from a tornado that kicked up a bunch of small parking lot pebbles and chipped them, passenger visor won&#39;t stay up, driver window won&#39;t go down more than half way cuz the track is bent from the tornado that ripped the door open; it needs a new door I&#39;ve tried repairing if 5 times, various scratches and small rust spots, stains on the seats and carpet, missing plastic cover plates around the interior, rear driver door lock actuator sticks open, short range on remote, windshield fluid doesn&#39;t spray up the windshield only on the bottom so I have to be driving 60mph to clean the windshield, just weird little quirks that don&#39;t bother me that I&#39;ve gotten used to and love about my Mrs. Shitbox. All these things can be fixed and I know what&#39;s wrong with all the issues listed but I don&#39;t feel like fixing them because they don&#39;t bother me that bad and don&#39;t effect my performance. I spend most my money up keeping the important stuff, eng, trans, rad, brakes, tires and suspension) My deal is once a repair is going to cost more than 2k or she needs a new engine then I&#39;m going to get a new\/used SUV. It can be used but I want it to be like Mrs. Shitbox, just a little better.<\/p>\n\n<p>She has a 3rd row that is slightly cramped. I would like maybe 2 or 3 more inches of room for the 3rd row. I know it&#39;s hard to find a roomier 3rd row with out going up in vehicle size. I love the size of Mrs. Shitbox, I can handle the shit out of her and cram her into some tight places, I don&#39;t like the bulky look or feel of let&#39;s say a Dodge Durango for an example. <\/p>\n\n<p>I would enjoy a Panaramic sunroof, I don&#39;t have one now but would love to have it. <\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m also looking for memory seats, I have back issues and I have to sit a certain way and if someone drives my car or I change the seat setting to vacuum it takes me a good 10 mins to find my spot and I don&#39;t always find it right away and hurt my back and have to adjust again. <\/p>\n\n<p>The reason why I want Beige and Light interior is because I feel like Beige or gold cars get pulled over less and go unnoticed most. I also live in Utah and it gets hot so a light color car is good for not getting too hot in the summers. I don&#39;t like white and I don&#39;t like silver. So here I am with beige. I love my beige car. A lot of places are not manufacturing beige cars so if I find the perfect car I&#39;ll have to just get a paint job I guess idk. <\/p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t want a big SUV I want it to be about the same size as my Santa Fe. This severely limits my options. <\/p>\n\n<p>Mrs. Shitbox does not pick up speed very well especially if there is any type of grade, getting onto the highway and getting up to speed is such a dramatic event so I am in search for more horse power. Currently I have 180hp and remember that thin high desert Utah air. She&#39;s a 2.7L V6. I only speed a little bit. The highway here is 70mph and usually cruise at 80 like everyone else. I don&#39;t need a race car I would just like to get up to speed a little faster. Once she&#39;s going then accelerating isn&#39;t as bad but the idiots here like to ride the on ramps to the highway at 20mph then merge into the highway then they have no problem getting up to speed. It takes me like a mile it seems like to go from 20mph up to 60 or 70. I need to use the on ramo to get up to speed but if I get stuck behind a truck or a slow ass then I&#39;m fucked for a mile trying to get up to speed. Living in Utah a lot of roads I drive on daily have grades and if I don&#39;t get speed at the bottom of the hill I won&#39;t be able to make the speed limit on the hill. Other cars seem to just zoom away from me even if they start out slow. It&#39;s so frustrating because if I&#39;m going slow behind them they can zoom away and I can&#39;t and I can&#39;t even get up to 45mph on this hill by my house on my daily commute. <\/p>\n\n<p>I realize I&#39;m a bit ridiculous with these requirements. To me it&#39;s a short list of demands and most other enjoyable luxury features are usually included on trim packs that come with the panoramic sunroofs etc so I don&#39;t list them. <\/p>\n\n<p>I have used cargurus and I got 4 results... I got 4 black Ford Explorers... I feel like there isn&#39;t a good platform for searching vehicles. Dealerships don&#39;t enerter the correct information and I have to sift through hundreds of cars that don&#39;t fit the bill. I&#39;ve been looking for years and I still haven&#39;t found 1 that I like. I really would like to buy a new Hyundai Santa Fe but they still just don&#39;t have the power and I&#39;ll be stuck in the same situation as I am now. I&#39;ve went to dealerships before and asked them to find me this car and they show me stuff with out 3rd rows or with out memory seats.. So idk if anyone can actually find this vehicle I want. <\/p>\n\n<p>If you read this far thank you.

I\u2019m looking to buy a new car in the near future. I\u2019m turning 25 soon and not really to worried about impracticality. This vehicle would be my fault driver and my only vehicle. I can find a good quality low mileage S2000 between $20,000 and $27,000 and I can find a low mileage 2017-2019 Civic Si Coupe for around $20,000. I live in Los Angeles but might relocate to Arizona. The goal for the car would be to drive me to and from work as well as spirited driving around twisties and even some long distance road trips. I plan on taking the car to many hiking trails and national parks in the California, Arizona, and Utah areas.  As a child the S2000 has always been a dream car and part of me is afraid that if I don\u2019t get my hands on one now, I may never be able to as the prices are only going up for clean vehicles. And on the other hand I feel like for a recent college grad the Civic Si Coupe wound just be a safer bet on costs, maintenance, and pretty much everything else. I love the idea of a rear wheel drive convertible roadster but at the same time the Civic Si has some nice features, would still be cheaper, and will have a warranty. Given all things considered should I go for the Civic Si Coupe? Or should I get the S2000?<\/p>\n\n<p>Also considering a Toyota 86 if I can find a used one in good condition\/reasonable price.<\/p>\n<\/div>","85":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: Midwest\nPrice range: 20-30k\nLease or Buy: Buy\nNew or used: Either\nType of vehicle: Car\/Sedan \nMust haves: Apple CarPlay, Lane Assist\/Adaptive Cruise, Leather, Heated Seats, Hybrid\nDesired transmission (auto\/manual, etc): Automatic\nIntended use: Daily\nVehicles you&#39;ve already considered: \nIs this your 1st vehicle: No, replacing 2012 Toyota Prius\nDo you need a Warranty: would be nice but no\nCan you do Minor work on your own vehicle: yes\nCan you do Major work on your own vehicle: no<\/p>\n\n<p>Additional Notes:\nHave worked in a job where I\u2019ve driven my own car a lot for the past few years, so didn\u2019t see a point in getting a newer car just to put miles on it.
