I am looking to buy not lease. Obviously used. I am looking at hatchbacks and compacts. It must have at least 70 horsepower and a fuel economy of 6-6.5 L\/100km. It must have a gasoline engine. Not looking into any features except electric front windows, power steering and a stereo radio. Preferably manual. Would use it as a daily driver and a fast way to get to the city. I need a running car, I&#39;m not experienced with repairs (major work) but I can do basic maintenance (minor work). I looked at cars like Peugeot 106, Renault Twingo first gen, mk4 and mk5 Golf and first gen Dacia Logan.

Going into the world of used car shopping with a very modest budget is extremely intimidating. Any advice on the best way to go about this search? Is it better to buy from a dealer or an individual? I\u2019ve read some pretty awful horror stories in the reviews of a lot of used car dealerships, and i\u2019m super scared of being taken advantage of.

For price range I&#39;m looking at AUD$1000-10000 but 15k might be fine I don&#39;t know. It would probably be a used car but if I can get it cheap as new then I would definitely not mind. It needs to be a RWD Sports car, manual transmission and a small car if possible.

The Smart is very cheap, apparently fuel efficient and rwd. I&#39;ve seen that people call it gay\/ hairdressers car but it seems quite nice. Its manual transmission is a bit odd though 6-speed automated manual transmission? Is this a manual or automatic? Also would I be able to drift with it because I really want to try that?

This is not a post of which car i should buy but rather which to keep. I am a 19 year old college student and currently have 2 cars, a 1997 honda accord DX and a 2006 civic EX(both manual). I will be using whichever car i keep to drive home on the weekends and to deliver food at my job. I have owned the 97 accord for 3 years and was my first car, the odometer reads 163k but was broken for an undisclosed period of time and is believed to be around 200-250k miles. I have done multiple repairs on it including upper &amp; lower ball joints, control arms, rear breaks, new break line, new cat, new muffler and new clutch cord (not sure if thats what its called) so overall I have put about 1,500 into it while i paid 1,000$ for it. I was not planning on getting a new car but the 06 was a very good deal i couldn\u2019t refuse. I bought it for 2,200$ with 182k miles on it and the owner was a honda technician for 30+ years and has owned and worked on it for the past 3 years. Always uses honda parts, keeps everything in perfect condition etc etc. The reason for the price is because the sun roof is completely shattered (it is covered with a new piece, but does not work) as well as no AC and a very small, minor chip in the front bumper. I will need to get new tires on the 06 this winter but other then that it is a very solid and no other problems to my knowledge and before purchasing I spent about 4 hours with the seller making sure everything was as he said and perfect. The 97 does not have working AC either, driver side mirror is broke (replaced with smaller after market trash mirror), decent amount of rust, lot of sun damage so paint looks like trash, possible break\/fuel line problem but unlikely. I would be fine driving either car, i do prefer the 06 as it is a more sporty car with tinted windows, no muffler (seller is storing it at his shop incase i want it for free) and it looks a lot better, but i have a much longer history with the 97 and i know more about it (other than the mileage).<\/p>\n<\/div>","31":"<div class=\"md\"><p><strong>Location:<\/strong> TX<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Price range:<\/strong> under 45k<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Lease or Buy:<\/strong> buy<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>New or used:<\/strong> either<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Type of vehicle:<\/strong> Sports Car (coupe or sedan)<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Must haves:<\/strong> RWD or AWD<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc):<\/strong> manual<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Intended use:<\/strong> Daily Driver<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered:<\/strong> 981 cayman, c6 corvette<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Is this your 1st vehicle:<\/strong> no<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you need a Warranty:<\/strong> no<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> yes<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> no<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Additional Notes:<\/strong>\nI own a Focus ST as my current daily, and a S2000 as a track car.

Also this will be posted on a few subreddits to get everyone&#39;s fair opinion. <\/p>\n\n<p>TL:DR - should i keep my 05 mustang gt (1 owner 60 k miles) OR should i buy a miata (1990-1998)  that i really want and sell the mustang? (would look for a very nice miata)<\/p>\n\n<p>So a little background(im 19), i started driving a 07 v6 mustang that i really liked but once i got my own car i really wanted a miata, long story short i owned a 01\u2019 miata for 6 months and a 93\u2019 miata for another six months. (basically owned a miata for a year). Unfortunately a car hit my Miata and I had to get rid of it.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now i always wanted a mustang after i had my own v6 and i also drove my friends 5.0 and a 10\u2019 gt. So at the time i was looking for a car my parents would not let me buy an old japanese car (specifically a miata) because on these last 2 miatas i had a lot of rust\/mold. They will also not let me get a stang at the time. (i was gonna get a focus st)<\/p>\n\n<p>We found this one mustang and I guess it was my lucky day and they let me get it. (i am paying for the car but they are helping a little bit). I got a 05 mustang gt with only about 60k miles and 1 owner, it&#39;s very clean and I have only seen this one so clean with so little miles.<\/p>\n\n<p>This is where the confusion begins, I drove the mustang for a while and even went to a mountain run. (same place I drove the Miata before too) . i really like the mustang but i feel like the miata was just more me, it has better handling, i like the look a lot better, and it has that old jap car feeling, i was thinking of just buying another miata and selling the mustang. I was looking for one but then i had this feeling that I don&#39;t want to sell the mustang.<\/p>\n\n<p>I only had this mustang for about 2 or 3 months and i still really like this car, it&#39;s super clean and i barely see mustangs like this with such low miles and only 1 owner. It&#39;s basically garage kept and the paint is almost perfect. every time i looked into one it had about 5 owners with 150 k miles.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now the engine is something else too. Even though it&#39;s the 4.6 v8 it&#39;s more than enough for me (from the miata 1.6 4 banger) it has all the power and torque i ever wanted and the sound is amazing, the look of the car is also just as good as the miata. <\/p>\n\n<p>So in the end i don&#39;t know if i should keep my mustang, or sell my mustang and buy an old miata again which i feel like i like better but very unsure (i basically stay up late some nights thinking about it lmao)<\/p>\n\n<p>Also money is not a problem and i don&#39;t care if \u201cthe miata is old is going to have more problems\u201d as i can always just fix it and if i did buy a miata i would wait to find the cleanest one.<\/p>\n\n<p>TL:DR - should i keep my 05 mustang gt (1 owner 60 k miles) OR should i buy a miata (1990-1998)  that i really want and sell the mustang?<\/p>\n<\/div>","58":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Hey guys, just need some personal experience regarding advices\/tips\/recommendations.

I have in mind some beefy tires with a full suspension, coils, end links, ect. With a nice interior with clean cloth or whatever, a rear half cage, somewhere just nice to be. I think the rsti fits these I just hate that I have to try really hard to find a clean one, pay too much for the car and then basically rip it down to a chassis and swap everything from a wrecked Sti to do it. I don\u2019t have the space to buy a wrecked Sti to do this swap. I can turbo a car or put a built engine in or whatever but I don\u2019t think I have the space for this. <\/p>\n\n<p>Thanks for the help and the discussion<\/p>\n<\/div>","73":"<div class=\"md\"><ul>\n<li><p><strong>Location:<\/strong> Minneapolis<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Price range:<\/strong> Flexible, $15-$30k <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Lease or Buy:<\/strong> Buy<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>New or used:<\/strong> Either<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Type of vehicle:<\/strong> Wagon\/small SUV\/large hatchback<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Must haves:<\/strong> Fuel efficient (esp.
