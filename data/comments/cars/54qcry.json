I know most people suggest getting cheap cars that don&#39;t use much petrol as their first cars but I have saved up a decent amount and actually want something nice. I have a 10k NZD limit which is about 7.5k USD. Essentially I want something relatively fast, looks nice, fuel efficient and relatively spacious. I like the look of Mazda 3&#39;s (Axela) and 6&#39;s. I also like the look of Honda Accords. I really quite like the hatchback style of the Axela&#39;s. But most of this is purely off the look of the vehicle as I do not know what makes a car good. So what do you guys recommend me getting and what things should I be aware of and be looking for when purchasing a car for the first time. tldr; what car would you suggest for new driver to get, budget of 10k NZD (7.5k USD)**<\/p>\n<\/div>","1":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Wondering if anyone could look at this craigslist ad, I&#39;ve been looking for a third gen camaro.

I want something new mostly for the warranty so I don&#39;t have to worry about repairs and maintenance for a while, as well as having a little more reliable. I live in a town that gets a good amount of snow every winter, but I&#39;ve been driving FWD\/RWD cars in it for years now. I&#39;m confident that I don&#39;t need AWD, but it would be nice to have. I&#39;ve never driven a turbo charged car in the snow though, and have no idea how that would change the dynamic. I imagine the kia or subaru would be cheapest to insure, the ST would be most expensive to run, the mazda3 with the 2.5 will have the highest invoice price, and the VW will probably be the most &quot;unreliable&quot; and least spacious (The kia is actually the most spacious of the bunch. A few more cubic feet of room than the subie).\nI have test driven the kia and st. St is also obviously the fastest of the group. Kia left a lot to be desired when I test drove it, but the 10 year\/100k warranty earns it tons of brownie points. I&#39;m sure I could buy better suspension and tune the kia to make it more fun to drive, but it also gets the worst MPG&#39;s of the bunch too (21\/29). And even though the korean manufacturers have stepped their game up, I&#39;m still apprehensive of buying a korean car. They come off as very cheap. <\/p>\n\n<p>I also have good credit (740), but im a 22 year old male, so insurance is going to fuck me no matter what I buy. It&#39;s going to be $150-200 a month. I could probably get ~$3k for a down payment, possibly $5k. I&#39;d also be willing to travel out of state where prices are a bit cheaper (sacramento\/auburn)<\/p>\n<\/div>","15":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Pretty much decided to trade in my 2014 VW Jetta TDI, but don&#39;t really know which direction I want to go.
