I really did enjoy the drive of the car, but the interior was about as bare bones as you could get. Cloth seats, dialpad, tiny little old screen. (and the RWD did not fair well in good ol&#39; Florida rain) <\/p>\n\n<p>I am almost totally deadset on getting a Maxima, but my overthinking has started to get me to question my decision with people complaining about the depreciation, FWD, shitty infotainment center, and how large it is. I personally really enjoyed my test drives, loved the interior (really annoyed the 16 and 17 didn&#39;t have android auto), and the BIGGEST proponent is that we have a close family friend who owns a Nissan Dealership and is going to the manufacturer sale on April 4th, which could save me thousands on my Maxima. I could end up in a 2016 or 2017 SL Leathered and featured out Maxima in the low 20s. <\/p>\n\n<p>I have been suggested to check out the BRZ\/86 which I have always had my eyes on, but seems to be pretty tiny and with the automatic &quot;the 86 feels more like a small, loud, underpowered, cramped coupe and less like a budget sports car&quot; according to one reviewer which is how I felt when I sat in one, although didn&#39;t get a chance to test drive. I could be totally wrong. <\/p>\n\n<p>I checked out the Hyundai Genesis Coupe (having owned a 2007 Hyundai Tiburon) and the driving honestly really didn&#39;t impress me. It felt very stiff, had decent handling, and not as much get up and go as I was expecting. <\/p>\n\n<p>The Lexus RC350 looked sharp but is out of my price range, the ....Lexi? Lexuses? ones I could afford didn&#39;t really wow me. <\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m really not interested in a BMW, I&#39;ve heard too many horror stories of repair costs<\/p>\n\n<p>I was worried about the repair costs of Audi as well, the A3 seemed way too small for me, but the A4 has me intrigued. I didn&#39;t get a chance to test drive it, but it seems juuuust at the edge of my max for my budget with the miles. Also still worried about luxury repair costs. <\/p>\n\n<p>I test drove a 2014 Infiniti Q50 and really enjoyed it, although enjoyed the Maxima better. The dual screen was a tad awkward, and I of course also worry about luxury costs of maintenance. Would love to get in a Q60S but out of my price range. <\/p>\n\n<p>Am I being stupid with wanting to get something sporty and not just getting a reliable Honda or Toyota boring sedan? Or maybe a Sonata 2.0 sport or Civic Sport? Is the Nissan Maxima with a heavy discount a horrible idea or am I just overthinking? I&#39;m 23, making decent money but I&#39;m not like pushing $75k+.
