Currently have a Camry in the US. Frankly we feel the Camry is way too large for NZ roads, so we want something shorter. The plan is to own this car long term (5+ years) and in that timeline we are looking to add a kid or 2 into the mix, so the car must be able to manage that. We won&#39;t have a reliable place to charge a plug-in, but with the fuel prices as they are (equivalent to about $6 USD \/ US Gal), and 99% of usage will be the bumper to bumper urban hellscape of Auckland - a hybrid is a logical choice.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Location: New Zealand<br\/>\nPrice range: $15-25k NZD<br\/>\nLease or Buy: Buy<br\/>\nNew or used: Used (NZ New or JDM Import)<br\/>\nType of vehicle: Hatch, small wagon, small crossover.<br\/>\nMust haves: Hybrid, front center arm rest, good visibility, 4 or 5 star safety. \nDesired transmission: Auto.<br\/>\nIntended use: Daily stuck in Auckland traffic.

Since there&#39;s basically no diff between a NZ-New C vs regular Prius in terms of price, plus the extra room, while still being a foot shorter than the Camry, in all objective ways the Prius is simply the logical choice. BUT - Maybe it&#39;s a bit shallow but we want a car in a color, and looking at TradeMe all the Prii are either white or silver. Also my dad owns a Gen 3 Prius in the US and I don&#39;t really want to drive my dad&#39;s car, if you know what I mean. Insult to injury - his is green. While the Honda Fit Hybrid also seems to only be available in white or silver - at least it&#39;s not a Prius? Obviously the Prius is much roomier and generally more comfortable, but for a subcompact choice the Fit isn&#39;t bad for space, which is why it&#39;s still for debate. I am a bit concerned about the DCT in the Fit - English language information is limited, and not terribly encouraging. BUT - controlling for age and mileage there is $10k-12k NZD separating the Fit from the Prius - and as fresh off the boat arrivals, spending $15k on a car is way more palatable than $25k. Nissan Note E-Power - interesting alternative to the Fit Hybrid, but I just hate how the Note looks. Suzuki Swift and Ignis look too small, also are only mild hybrids.<\/p>\n\n<p>TL;DR -- Prius is on paper best fit and basically nails all our requirements except my hang up of driving my dad&#39;s car.  But it also costs $10k more than the scrappy Honda alternative, which I am a bit concerned about for reliability, and also the size still being acceptable to us when kids enter the picture.\n\u200b<\/p>\n<\/div>","25":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Am I literally throwing money away by leasing a car for 4 years?<\/p>\n\n<p>If I\u2019m looking around 300\/month, that\u2019s 14.4K over four years.

My ideal car would either be a manual Golf R wagon or a manual B8 S4 wagon, but unfortunately neither of those are available in the US. <\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m basically just trying to think through what I can get for the price of Golf R + a little on top that will get me close to that experience. Currently debating between a newer car like the BMW 328i or going a bit older like an S4 avant and just putting aside some money to fix\/modernize it (timing chain job on the engine etc.) Probably what would make the most sense is getting a VW Alltrak and building it out but I bought a new clutch for my R a bit ago and don&#39;t particularly want to do that again, and I think the Alltrak would need a new clutch if I wanted to tune. <\/p>\n\n<p>Honestly I think currently I&#39;m leaning towards finding a clean manual S4 avant and setting aside the extra money to fix it as needed but I&#39;m open to hearing other ideas. Not opposed to transmission\/engine swaps if they&#39;re well documented (ie. something like the manual swapped S6 on BaT right now)<\/p>\n<\/div>","31":"<div class=\"md\"><p>A Yeti<\/p>\n<\/div>","32":"<div class=\"md\"><p><strong>Location:<\/strong> :GA, USA<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Price range:<\/strong> :55-65k <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Lease or Buy:<\/strong> Buy<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>New or used:<\/strong> Either <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Type of vehicle:<\/strong> Sports Car \/ fast sedan whatever <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Must haves:<\/strong> Adjustable drive modes, leather, RWD or AWD<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Desired transmission<\/strong> auto only <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Intended use:<\/strong> Half daily \/ fun car <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered:<\/strong> BMW M3, BMW M2, Audi RS3, Audi RS5, Audi TTRS <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Is this your 1st vehicle:<\/strong> no <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you need a Warranty:<\/strong> no but it would be nice <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> (fluids, alternator, battery, brake pads etc): yes<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> (engine and transmission, timing belt\/chains, body work, suspension etc ): no <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Additional Notes:<\/strong> I already have an SUV so I don&#39;t need practicality<\/p>\n<\/div>","33":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[gel\u00f6scht]<\/p>\n<\/div>","34":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Posting in the new thread because I didn&#39;t realize I posted in last week&#39;s<\/p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;<\/p>\n\n<p>Location: North Florida, USA<\/p>\n\n<p>Price range: 30-45k<\/p>\n\n<p>Lease or Buy: Finance<\/p>\n\n<p>New or used: Certified Used<\/p>\n\n<p>Type of vehicle: Wagon<\/p>\n\n<p>Must haves: Adaptive cruise, cooled seats, premium audio.<\/p>\n\n<p>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc): Auto for sure.<\/p>\n\n<p>Intended use: Daily driver, long work drive commute, road trips<\/p>\n\n<p>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: VW Golf Alltrack, Audi A4 Allroad, Audi Q5, BMW 328d x-drive sports wagon, E-class wagon<\/p>\n\n<p>Is this your 1st vehicle: No<\/p>\n\n<p>Do you need a Warranty: Yes<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle: Definitely<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle: Somewhat.

My 4Runner can\u2019t comfortably tow that something like that all over, so I\u2019m looking to buy a new midsized truck in the next month or so.

Tacoma towing capacity (v6 4x4 short bed) is 6400 lbs, while a similar canyon is 7000 lbs.  while I\u2019ve towed loads numerous times before, I\u2019m not experienced towing large loads.  I\u2019m less sure on the Tacoma\u2019s ability to comfortably tow that load with what I read is a questionable 6 speed transmission, and no amount of reading seems to clarify.

The Tacoma does seem to have every safety feature under the sun, while the canyon is lacking most features (lane alert and braking alert only).

Either truck has similar options otherwise, although the canyon is slightly more comfortable. <\/p>\n\n<p>Any thoughts and info would be greatly appreciated.
