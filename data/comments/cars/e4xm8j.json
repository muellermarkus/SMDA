Also considering the Omega since parts are cheaper and I&#39;ve test driven one.<\/p>\n\n<p>The problem is these are all pretty far away from me and from eachother, with the exception of the E34 and Omega which are in the same town (still 2.5h from me), so I don&#39;t really have the chance to test every one, so I have pretty much have to make my choice before going to see one.<\/p>\n<\/div>","1":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Location:<\/strong> Florida, USA  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Price range:<\/strong> $20-$26k  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Lease or Buy: Either<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>New or used: Preferably New, but would consider a year or 2 older.<\/strong>   <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Type of vehicle: Sedan<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Must haves:<\/strong> Fuel Efficient, Nice Interior, Smooth Ride  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc): Auto<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Intended use: Daily Driver<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: Honda Accord, Toyota Camry, Honda Civic, Hyundai Sonata<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Is this your 1st vehicle: No<\/strong>   <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you need a Warranty: Yes<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> Very Minor  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> No  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Additional Notes: Leaning towards the Honda Accord Sport 1.5 T, but wanted to see what others thought first.<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<\/div>","2":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Currently heavily leaning towards a G70 or Stinger for primarily winter driving and the rare occasion during spring\/summer I need more then 2 seats.

Yes 3 very different cars AWD, RWD,FWD. The IS-F is from \u201808-\u201814 and around 70,000-120,000 miles is around $20,000-25,000. The IS350 a \u201815-\u201817 is around the same price but with fewer miles around 20-50k. The accord is again similar price \u201816 and \u201817 and again similar miles to 350. I\u2019m up in the air of which one to buy the ISF with it\u2019s V8, IS350 with that great 3.5L V6 with cooler seats, heated steering wheel and many safety features or the coupe with its good looks countless safety features reliable 3.5L and it runs on 87 octane unlike the other two. The ISF most of the time has multiple owners as well an not being CPO. The other 2 are commonly certified pre owned and have 1 owner.
