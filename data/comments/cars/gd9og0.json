There are lots of sports cars I&#39;d have no problem getting but I need to satisfy my wife and I&#39;s need for a DD that&#39;s a family car as we&#39;ll be having a kid or two soon. This will probably be long and someone will probably tell me to be more realistic and piss off which would be fair and I&#39;ll probably give up and do that but I&#39;m hoping for someone else&#39;s thoughts as I&#39;m the only person in my life that actually cares about the driving experience. With that....  <\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m looking for a hatchback or small wagon with a manual (or even electric) that has AWD or RWD, very much leaning to AWD that is small. I have a huge passion for tiny cars. My wife&#39;s is a 2013 Mazda 2 and if I could just have that in AWD I would be over the moon. I have had my eye on 2008-2014 wagon WRX&#39;s since they came out as they have everything and I think look great. But now that I have the money they are obviously well used (there are low mileage ones for sale). Trouble is my wife insists on a new or certified car that has a factory warranty and I agree that is the smartest option but I&#39;m struggling to find anything in my price range that has what I want. I said up to 30k but I&#39;m only willing to go over 23k for something that i really love.   <\/p>\n\n<p>There is a WRX for sale in my area with sort of low miles that checks the boxes but its 2013 and I&#39;ll have to argue for it with the mrs and I&#39;d rather not if I can.  I have test drove a 2017 Crosstrek and a 2019 Impreza. I did not like the Impreza and thought the Crosstrek was not too bad but it was slow. I know I&#39;ll get some shit about them being the same car but theres some differences and it was a deal breaker.   <\/p>\n\n<p>There are several wagon AWD options out there but I have not had personal experiences with them and am looking for thoughts from others with a consideration on size. I really find the current impreza\/crosstrek to be at the absolute max of the size I would consider. additionally, I try not to be too snobbish about cars but I want to lean away from American brands as my experience has shown the quality to be the source of the low cost. But I will consider them if recommended with the exception of GM. I cannot be convinced to buy one.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Just to ramble more, to be real I&#39;m looking to be convinced not to go for a low mile 2014 WRX with something tempting that will sate the need for a warranty. I work on cars all the time and maintenance\/repair does not scare me but I would like a car to be as low maintenance as possible cuz I&#39;m lazy and my wife gets anxious about costs and such.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<\/div>","18":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Location:<\/strong> (USA- Northern California)  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Price range:<\/strong> 20k-30k USD with taxes and fees   <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Lease or Buy:<\/strong> Buy  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>New or used:<\/strong> New preferably or under 10k miles if used  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Type of vehicle:<\/strong>  Car, Sports Car, Sedan, or Crossover  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Must haves:<\/strong> Sporty\/Athletic feel, decent fuel efficiency(at least 20 city and 30), reliable brand, something unique (everyone i know drives a civic, accord, or corolla), and safe  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc):<\/strong> automatic  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Intended use:<\/strong> Daily Driver  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered:<\/strong> Subaru WRX premium cvt - A little above my budget and not fuel efficient enough  <\/p>\n\n<p>Mazda 3 Hatchback AWD - Not enough power  <\/p>\n\n<p>Volkswagen Jetta GLI - Does Volkswagen make reliable cars?  <\/p>\n\n<p>Hyundai Veloster- Looks are growing on me, but still ugly imo.   <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Is this your 1st vehicle:<\/strong> No  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you need a Warranty:<\/strong> No  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> No  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> No  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Additional Notes:<\/strong> I&#39;ve driven a Prius the past 6 years.

I&#39;m not in the market anytime soon thanks to COVID, but I do want to buy a new NA V8 with a manual transmission before they&#39;re extinct, and I&#39;ve narrowed my choices down to the Camaro 2SS, Mustang GT PP1, and Challenger Scat Pack Widebody.  The Camaro is my number 1 because of its pure performance capabilities and driver engagement, but it&#39;s also not as heavily discounted as the other two.  <\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m torn on how to rank the other two.  The Challenger is more practical, and it appeals to my inner 5 year old.  It&#39;s unapologetic at trying to be a raging bull with it&#39;s 2.2 tons of heft, and it&#39;s shaped like one two with its unapologetic large proportions.  It does make compromises on handling as a result though, and while I don&#39;t live near too many twisty canyon\/mountain roads (Florida problems),  I do enjoy driving the most when I get to corner at speed.  The Mustang is significantly lighter than the Challenger and I&#39;d imagine sportier as well.  It&#39;s also a nice midde ground between the uncompromising sports car that the Camaro is and the uncompromising muscle car that the Challenger is.  That being said, my inner 5 year old is shouting louder than my inner sensible 27 year old.  If the trade-off in handling is small, my heart says go with the Challenger second and Mustang third.  <\/p>\n\n<p>What are your experiences with the two cars?<\/p>\n<\/div>","85":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[gel\u00f6scht]<\/p>\n<\/div>","86":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Location:<\/strong> Vancouver, Canada  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Price range:<\/strong> 8000-12000  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Lease or Buy:<\/strong> Buy  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>New or used:<\/strong> Used  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Type of vehicle:<\/strong> Truck or SUV  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Must haves:<\/strong> 4x4, Enough space to fit tools, fishing\/hunting gear, if SUV roof rails as I would get a roof box  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc):<\/strong> Auto preferred, manual can be relearned  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Intended use:<\/strong> Daily driver, work truck (am electrician for small company so tools are carried often), bush rig  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered:<\/strong> Toyota 4runner V6, Toyota Hilux Surf 3.0l Diesel, Mitsubishi Pajero  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Is this your 1st vehicle:<\/strong> No. Currently own 2001 Rav4 4cyl  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you need a Warranty:<\/strong> No  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> Yes  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> Yes to suspension, brakes, and belts.
