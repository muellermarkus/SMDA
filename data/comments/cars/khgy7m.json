Fun as hell car, probably not the most practical daily. But that may have been due to the lack of any options. I think throwing on some options to make it more dailyable would be helpful, and going to an S would just make it that much more fun. <\/p>\n\n<p>Now, the price jump to a 911 is pretty significant. You can get a lot more Boxster for the money. I\u2019ve crossed off a 997.2 as the interior and tech is pretty damn outdated at this point and the PCM is garbage - you can\u2019t Bluetooth stream audio outside of extensive upgrades or a dongle which I\u2019m skeptical of. <\/p>\n\n<p>At my price range I\u2019m basically looking at a base 991.1 or, if I want to roll the dice, a 991.1 S with minor accident history.

I test drove a used 2019 forte yesterday at a certified dealer but they tried to sneak in $2300 in add ons that ruined the deal I would have been getting. I started looking into the Cruze today because my family has had decent experiences with Chevy and a local dealer and the prices are tempting. Though I have heard that Chevy is now low quality so I am unsure of any potential issues that could ruin the value and cause a lot of hassle.<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<\/div>","52":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Location:<\/strong> Central Texas<br\/>\n<strong>Price range:<\/strong> $10,000 - $19,000<br\/>\n<strong>Lease or Buy: Buy<\/strong><br\/>\n<strong>New or used: Used<\/strong><br\/>\n<strong>Type of vehicle:<\/strong> Car \/ Sports Car<br\/>\n<strong>Must haves:<\/strong> Reasonably Fuel Efficient<br\/>\n<strong>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc): Auto<\/strong><br\/>\n<strong>Intended use:<\/strong> Daily Driver<br\/>\n<strong>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: Ford Mustang, Subaru BRZ, Audi TT, BMW 328i<\/strong><br\/>\n<strong>Is this your 1st vehicle: Yes<\/strong><br\/>\n<strong>Do you need a Warranty: No<\/strong><br\/>\n<strong>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> Yes<br\/>\n<strong>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> No<br\/>\n<strong>Additional Notes:<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<\/div>","53":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: SoCal<\/p>\n\n<p>Price range: Ideally 10k to 15k but am open to going up to around 17k pre-tax<\/p>\n\n<p>Lease or Buy: Buy<\/p>\n\n<p>New or used: Used (Less than 50k miles, and nothing older than 2015\/2016)<\/p>\n\n<p>Type of vehicle: Something smaller, sedan or hatchback <\/p>\n\n<p>Must haves: Blind spot monitoring, rear view camera, and enough room to store some junk in the trunk (bike). <\/p>\n\n<p>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc): Indifferent<\/p>\n\n<p>Intended use: Daily Driver<\/p>\n\n<p>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: Lexus CT200h, Hyundai Elantra, Hyundai Kona, and VW Golf.
