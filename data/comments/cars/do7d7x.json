It has absolutely no features. No cruise control, no keyless entry, no Bluetooth (or even an aux plug), so I have to use an fm transmitter to listen to music from my phone. It has about 85,000 miles on it and it\u2019s in good condition, though. I just replaced the AC for like 1k and got all new tires last year. When I got the oil changed yesterday, the mechanic said that everything looks good. <\/p>\n\n<p>I have the opportunity to get a 2013 Chevy Cruze Eco that is basically loaded with features. It has a sunroof, backup camera, touchscreen radio system, Bluetooth, cruise control (never even considered this a bonus until my current car), keyless entry, the works. However, it has 120,000 miles. <\/p>\n\n<p>We would be getting it from a neighbor, so it\u2019s not a random on the internet, and the way I would be getting it wouldn\u2019t require money on my part except registering it. We are getting a really good price and the only reason they are getting rid of it is because the person who owns the car now received a nicer car from someone who passed away. They were not planning on getting rid of it anytime soon. <\/p>\n\n<p>My concern is that Cruzes have mixed reviews online, but these people have not had any problems and from what I see, people who have had problems usually started having problems pretty quickly. These people have also maintained the car well and there was some issue that all these cars had that would cause it to overheat and cause issues related to that, but that was dealt with before it caused them any issues. <\/p>\n\n<p>Tl;dr: do I take the upgrade or stick with my car that seems to be in good shape atm?<\/p>\n<\/div>","16":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Location:<\/strong> Seattle, Washington, USA  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Price range:<\/strong> 20k-25k USD  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Lease or Buy:<\/strong> Buy  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>New or used:<\/strong> Not sure.

Not the sportiest car but I think it&#39;s enough to have fun on backroads and enjoy my interstate commute.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>&#39;16 Lexus IS 200t F-sport: Not as nice of an interior as the RC and the engine felt really slow. Not a fan.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>&#39;19 Hyundai Veloster Turbo: I liked this, didn&#39;t take a long test drive unfortunately though. Didn&#39;t feel like an upgrade from my GTI though (except for android auto\/carplay)<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>&#39;17 Alfa Romeo Giulia: I felt the interior wasn&#39;t as nice as the Lexus and since this was the base it didn&#39;t have paddle shifters. Probably should have found backroads for this car but only really test drove on normal streets. Felt pretty normal. <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>&#39;17 BMW 228i: Couldn&#39;t find a M235 nearby so I tried this. Interior felt cheaper than I was anticipating but I did like the engine in this. Made me lean away from the BMW M235i.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>&#39;19 Toyota 86: I could tell this would be an awesome car on backroads but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s right for my daily commute. To me power is probably more important than handling since I can use it more often.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>&#39;17 Mazda Miata RF: This car was really awesome, loved the convertible aspect of it and it definitely made me want a convertible in my life at some point. My thinking is to get a daily car now and maybe a convertible sometime down the road (I&#39;ve been lusting at Mazdaspeed Miatas for awhile), especially since I like to road trip often.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>So, currently I&#39;m leaning heavily towards a Lexus RC 350, if I can ever find one in my desired spec (adaptive cruise, non white\/grey\/black exterior, non black interior), but I&#39;ve been thinking about other options I haven&#39;t tried yet. Acura TLX A-spec SH-AWD (probably not for me, and they&#39;re still ~30k used), Veloster N (I&#39;d have to learn manual, and probably not a great commuter?), a new Mazda3 (probably not enough oomph, but I love the design), new GTI (great warranty and pretty good at everything), BMW 4 series (not a fan of the design, and pretty common, but I feel I should give it a shot). Is there anything I&#39;m missing here before I pull the trigger on an RC? I&#39;m not interested in any muscle cars, and I thought about an ATS but I&#39;ve decided there are better options in its segment. I&#39;ve also thought about a ~&#39;10 Cayman, but haven&#39;t looked heavily into that.<\/p>\n\n<p>EDIT<\/p>\n\n<p>Or, my crazy idea is to get something cheaper (Revive my Reatta, Acura RSX, Lexus SC300, I love RX-8&#39;s but probably don&#39;t want to deal with rotaries, although I already keep extra oil in my hatch so maybe I&#39;m prepared haha) and wait until I can afford cars I&#39;m really lusting over (Supra, RC-F, M2, V6 Genesis G70).<\/p>\n<\/div>","51":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[gel\u00f6scht]<\/p>\n<\/div>","52":"<div class=\"md\"><p><strong>Location:<\/strong> Finland, Uusimaa, includes Helsinki, Espoo and Vantaa<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Price range:<\/strong> max 250\u20ac<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Lease or Buy:<\/strong> Buy<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>New or used:<\/strong> Used, absolutely not from dealership<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Type of vehicle:<\/strong> Preferably not a van, but anything will do.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Must haves:<\/strong> It moves, it&#39;s good<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc):<\/strong> Manual, not must have but preferable<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Intended use:<\/strong> daily drive, around 50km\/month.
