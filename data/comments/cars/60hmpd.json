And I have a few questions:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>I have got some quotes that are $4-5k below MSRP before TTL just from those online emails they send out to me. My inexperienced brain feels like this is a good deal, but are there generally catches to these offers? Is there still room to negotiate down? (Is it even worth it?) <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>One says that I have to finance through the dealer at &quot;standard rates&quot; which makes me think I won&#39;t be able to negotiate a better interest rate but will be locked into something like 3% when my credit history may potentially set me up for a better rate. Is this something to worry about?<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>More generally, is there some rule of thumb on the amount to put in a down payment, or is this something that is really up to me based on my financial situation?
