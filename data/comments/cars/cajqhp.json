Bought it new. I like the small cars, despite the fact that it sometimes seems like everyone else in the US  drives pickups and SUVs. It has been a reliable car that is fun to drive with very few problems over the past nine years, with the exception that I currently need a new AC system (~$1,000 USD). The AC problem is not the reason that I&#39;m looking at a new car. There are no major mechanical problems with the car currently. During the summer, I&#39;m getting about 36 mpg with mainly highway driving.<\/p>\n\n<p>But, over the past two years, my commute has changed, and I now drive 120 miles daily, mainly on the interstate. Problems with this car include loud cabin noise, unsteady at high speeds, and not the most comfortable seat and leg space. This is all tolerable while tooling around town and taking an occasional road trip, but with my new commute, these quaint charms become really annoying. Secondary issues is that I&#39;m using 2019 personal technology with all sorts of wires criss-crossing my car for charging and connectivity, and at times it gets to be a little tiresome, especially when I drive in my friends&#39; modern cars.<\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m considering buying another small car. I have not test-driven anything yet, I&#39;m still at the very early stages research. I intend to get a manual transmission. My budget will be up to about $25k, perhaps a bit more. Hardtop, two or all-wheel drive, 2 4 or 5 door. Cars that I have thought about include the Mini Cooper, VW Golf, Honda Civic, Toyota Prius (I recognize that this is not manual transmission).<\/p>\n\n<p>I would appreciate suggestions of specific cars. I also would appreciate opinions on buying new vs. used. I put in about 30K miles per year, so anything with too high mileage going into a used car is not appealing.<\/p>\n\n<p>Thanks much for any thoughts!<\/p>\n<\/div>","76":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I get cold winters and hot summers so maybe the Mazda isn\u2019t the way to go<\/p>\n<\/div>","77":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[gel\u00f6scht]<\/p>\n<\/div>","78":"<div class=\"md\"><p><strong>Location:<\/strong> Nevada, but I can get it from California too<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Price range:<\/strong> $250\/month<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Lease or Buy:<\/strong> lease<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>New or used:<\/strong> Preferably new, open to a one or two year old model<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Type of vehicle:<\/strong> 4-door sedan<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Must haves:<\/strong> strong safety rating, would be nice to have some nice features like power seats, bluetooth, parking assist, etc.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Desired transmission:<\/strong> automatic<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Intended use:<\/strong> family car, not high-intense use<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered:<\/strong> Passat (not happy about their safety rating)<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Is this your 1st vehicle:<\/strong> No<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you need a Warranty:<\/strong> Yes<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> No<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> No<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Additional Notes:<\/strong> Just want good value for the price, I&#39;m not as bothered by looks as I am by practicality (safety, features, performance, etc).
