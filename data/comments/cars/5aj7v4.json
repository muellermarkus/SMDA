I&#39;d also love bluetooth in the car or at least an auxiliary jack for my phone so I can listen to music with something other than a damn CD. Also, I just want a car that&#39;s fun to drive. I currently drive a 2009 Mitsubishi Galant and it drives horribly and doesn&#39;t have any sort of audio ports or anything inside of it. I&#39;ve grown to hate the car even though it&#39;s honestly been pretty reliable thus far... My galant also has very little power and struggles to speed up since it&#39;s a heavy car and doesn&#39;t have much of an engine. Something that accelerates at a respectable speed would be lovely.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Intended use<\/strong>: Daily driving. Perhaps the occasional road trip but nothing too extravagant.

That might lessen to 15 miles, or increase up to 60 or so in a few weeks though. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered<\/strong>: Ford Mustang Ecoboost, Genesis Coupe (a little low on gas mileage but still good), Subaru WRX<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Is this your 1st vehicle<\/strong>: No, as I stated above, I currently own a 2009 Mitsubishi Galant, not a fan.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Does the vehicle need to have a warranty<\/strong>: Ideally, yes.

So if the vehicle has each of these features readily accessible so it wouldn&#39;t be too difficult that would be lovely.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle<\/strong>: Certainly not even though, again, I would love to learn. But in this case I&#39;d be way too afraid to try it on a brand new rather expensive vehicle.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Additional Notes<\/strong>: To be honest, right now I&#39;m kind of window shopping. I&#39;m supposed to get a call regarding a job tonight, and depending on the offer they give me I&#39;m thinking I may buy a new car. I&#39;m not 100% sure what I want, but I am 100% sure that my current car functions just fine and that I don&#39;t NEED a new car. I would just like one that is a smoother and more fun ride all around. The power steering in my car is rough and overall the vehicle is heavy and kind of a pain to drive. So right now I&#39;m trying to get ideas. I might not even buy another car for a year or so, so cars that aren&#39;t out yet might be worth looking at too if they fit the bill.
