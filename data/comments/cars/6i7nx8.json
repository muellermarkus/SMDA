I&#39;ve been looking at both of these cars in automatic but I&#39;m torn between them. The Civic is very boring to drive in comparison to my current car (gas+steering). The Elantra is more of an interactive driving experience (sport mode, paddle shifters). Both have features I desire (backup camera, bluetooth, android auto, sunroof, leather)\nWhat I&#39;m hesitant on is the quality of the Hyundai after 5ish years, and the fast expiring &#39;fun&#39; factor of the Honda. I do about 12+ hours of driving a week and having the occasional smile on my face during a commute is big to me. Civic&#39;s more expensive and well, it&#39;s a Honda, built to last. But will the Hyundai? Also hesitant to buy a new car for the massive hit of depreciation. Civics I could find used (2016) but they are rare. The Elantra Sport I&#39;d have to buy new because it&#39;s the first year they are out.

I&#39;m on work travel, since I&#39;m not with my shenanigans back home my mind wanders and I&#39;m wandering deep into the car world.<\/p>\n\n<p>I currently have a 2016 Audi A5 coupe, I have two years on that lease, but as stated before, work travel so for funsies decided to post here and read some car people input. There&#39;s a lot to love about that car for me. However, one flaw that&#39;s pretty important for me, it doesn&#39;t have that &quot;wow what a sports car&quot; feel. The nice but generic rims\/brakes, the luxurious but not exciting interior as well as exterior. Problem is, that car is at the peak affordability for me ($50k msrp), while I could afford something more expensive it would be at a great sacrifice that honestly, with me always finding things that don&#39;t fit me in the cars I have make me not want to make that sacrifice. I rather have money and a car I find something not fitting to me than to have no money and still find something that doesn&#39;t fit me. Before the Audi I had a BRZ, and that car had all the &quot;wow what a sports car&quot; side but it was a rough daily driver hence why I was ready to part with it. The idea of a Camaro is exciting but something about muscle cars and V8s are a bit of a turn off for me, maybe because the only people I know that have those V8s are dudebros &quot;haha V8 bro!&quot; that don&#39;t really care about other aspects of a car other than straight horse power\/torque.<\/p>\n\n<p>So what do you guys think? I&#39;m chasing a holy grail here? No such thing as a one size fit all for the schmuck that can&#39;t go past $50k msrp? I&#39;m beginning to think that I could just go for 2 cheaper cars, one daily driver and one weekend car, but I feel like I couldn&#39;t put up with a crappy daily driver either to have a nice car I only drive on weekends.<\/p>\n<\/div>","76":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Late to the party, so I don&#39;t know if anyone will see this, but I&#39;ve been shopping for a new car for a long time now. I&#39;ve bounced between a lot of cars (Civic Si, Fiesta ST, GTI and even trucks, and smaller econoboxes). Recently I decided to toss the warranty idea out the window, and start shopping for something newer than what I&#39;m used to, but still fun. <\/p>\n\n<p>I settled on a Mk5 R32. They can be had ~$15k, sub 100k miles, and so on. I&#39;m not too bothered by it being DSG only, and I love the VR6 worble. The obvious concern is reliability. Part of this purchase was because I was getting fed up with my Mk2 breaking down. From what I read the R32 is decently reliable, although the timing chain guides are a concern. But it is an obtainable dream car, and since I&#39;m cutting down my fleet to this and my Baja Bug, I don&#39;t mind wrenching on it now and again.<\/p>\n\n<p>But I try to be sensible about everything, and I always look for input on to what I should cross shop. Ultimately, this may very well be a stupid idea.

I currently drives a 2005 CLK55 AMG Cabriolet (362HP), paid $30k 4 years ago now it&#39;s worth around $14k for a depreciation of $4k a year. Cars been reliable and I had only had fuel pump went out that cost me $1100 and regular maintenance maybe $1500 over the 4 years. so that puts my total ownership cost about say $4500 a year. I&#39;m looking for something similar cost of ownership, no more than $20k over 4 years.\nNow I&#39;m kind of getting bored of the car as I&#39;m looking for something faster. Maybe around 500HP. I drove a brand new C63S coupe and it was quite sweet, but I don&#39;t think dropping $90k on a new car that will depreciate to $40 in 4 years makes sense for me right now.\nI&#39;ve looked at few cars but can&#39;t decide on which. saw a 2005 SL65 (600hp) listed for $28k, but It was sold the day I wanted to look. I also researched that these cars are $$$ to repair as the ABC suspension will always fail so they could go over budget if things break. Saw a few SL55s and same story with the repair bill.\nThen I was looking at a C6 corvettes, they don&#39;t seem to depreciate as much and the C7 makes C6 looks very ugly. Maybe I should just get a C7 since depreciation is low? a 4 year old corvette I calculated will probably depreciate from $70k to $40k = $30k ownership cost, so I&#39;ll be over budget by $10k over 4 years.\nJaguar XFR (510hp) seem good bang for the buck, $30k for fairly newer model but then the 4 door sedan seem kind of boring.\nThen I looked at the 63 series AMGS but I heard the M156 NA motor has reliability problems with head bolt and cam shaft so I&#39;m not too sure on those.\nThought about Porsches but anything around 500HP is too expensive and they don&#39;t seem to depreciate much and the ones do fall in price range seem to have reliability problems too.\nPony cars are nice but they are too common and I like to drive something more unique.\nIn the end I&#39;m kind of lost and not sure what car I should buy since the price\/performance\/looks ratio of my current car is pretty hard to beat.
