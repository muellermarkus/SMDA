I&#39;ve recently come across a clean, one-owner, meticulously maintained RSX Type S. I&#39;ve been meaning to get into Autocross more and more recently, and want a somewhat more efficient and tossable daily driver. I love my TL, and it wouldn&#39;t necessarily go away (would keep it in the family), but it would be under someone else&#39;s policy, should they want the TL. Insurance has been worked out and will not be an issue. My key concerns are as follows:<\/p>\n\n<p>How comfortable is the RSX on longer trips? How is the road noise? (I can get a feel for road noise during test drive, but comfort is something that I&#39;d like some insight on)<\/p>\n\n<p>Does lack of an LSD really make a difference? I&#39;ve only autocrossed my S2K, and it was a blast, so that&#39;s my point of reference. I don&#39;t expect the RSX (with lack of LSD and FWD) to feel anything like S2000, but would hope that it&#39;s still a fun lil meme car, and more importantly, fosters improved driving skills.<\/p>\n\n<p>Would you personally think there&#39;s a major trade off in giving up the TL for the RSX? I don&#39;t need rear doors (although I do like the practicality of a 4-door).<\/p>\n\n<p>Lastly, would YOU make the change from a TL to an RSX if you were looking for something tossable (with a manual)?<\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ll add more if I can think of anything else.
