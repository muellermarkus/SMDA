So I recently started my $15\/hr (been working for awhile) job and was thinking of getting myself a second weekend car in the near future. I have a 2005 Toyta Avalon so I don&#39;t have to worry about a daily driver. I&#39;m considering a NC Miata with FM Targa package and doing some minor work myself, the car around this area are around 7k plus the package would bring the total price to around $15.5k. But with that money I also consider thing like a skyline r32, Impreza STi, Toyota 86, 350z. Anyone have recommendation for any sporty coupe or should I save up for the Targa Miata?<\/p>\n<\/div>","14":"<div class=\"md\"><p><strong>Location<\/strong>: Canada<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Price range<\/strong>: $15,000 minimum - $75,000 maximum<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>New or used<\/strong>: I don&#39;t want brand new if possible.
