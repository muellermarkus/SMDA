Fun, and no issues overall, but I&#39;ve got some rust developing near the antenna box, and Ford has flat-out told me no to warranty coverage twice, leaving me a little turned off of the car and Ford in general. Had a bit of a career bump (the good kind) recently, and just wondering how rational\/ irrational a new vehicle would be. Currently owe about $12k on the FiST and it&#39;s worth about $14k. Payment + insurance currently sit at about $400\/ month. An STI would be a little over $700\/ month (plus about $8k down, so financing ~$32k), and of course fuel costs increase considerably. That&#39;s a substantial increase over the Fiesta, where I can be a little more lax with other monthly expenses\/ hobbies. I&#39;d definitely need to test drive first, but I also wanted to get opinions on the proposition before I move forward\/ get serious with it.<\/p>\n<\/div>","4":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Not really a &#39;what should I buy&#39; but rather what should I be looking at?<\/p>\n\n<p>Looking for something in <strong>Canada<\/strong> that fills the void left by Smart Car&#39;s absence.

I\u2019m considering leasing a 2021 Dodge Ram warlock and was looking for some insight on this. <\/p>\n\n<p>I wasn\u2019t in the market for a truck, although I like them. It\u2019s a practical vehicle being a Canadian. Even though I live in southern Canada, we still get a fair amount of snow in the winters.<\/p>\n\n<p>The trucks MSRP is about $55k. As a recent graduate, it wouldn\u2019t be wise of me to finance a vehicle anywhere near that price. I make about $60k\/year + side hustles that pay for some of my spending money. I have about $12k left on my student loan (should be done by around February 2022, the lease payment wouldn\u2019t delay this) and aside from insurance and regular bills, I have no other expenses. I live with my parents rent-free. <\/p>\n\n<p>The car costs $79 + tax weekly, $2500 down, 2 year lease at 0.0% APR.<\/p>\n\n<p>I currently drive a 2004 BMW 3 series.

I\u2019d imagine I can get $2000 for it now almost solely because it comes with winter &amp; summer tires with nice BMW rims. However, it has no heat, barely working AC, an exhaust leak and about 270,000kms. These issues didn\u2019t become apparent until recently. The previous 4 years of ownership were excellent and the car treated me very well.<\/p>\n\n<p>My dilemma is that I don\u2019t commute for work - I work from home. However, I go to the gym every morning before work. In the winter it\u2019s a hassle because my car doesn\u2019t remotely start, have working heat and it\u2019s RWD. It\u2019s the same story in the summer with the AC being sub par. I\u2019m also feeling guilty for asking my girlfriend to drive everywhere we go, as it puts more km\u2019s on her car and she\u2019s just graduating now so a car payment won\u2019t be in her budget for a bit until she\u2019s settled into a job. <\/p>\n\n<p>Is this lease worth it in my scenario?<\/p>\n<\/div>","24":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;m no way a car enthusiast.

I&#39;m sure I can talk that price down, but I want to know if it&#39;s going to be a pain for someone who is pretty inexperienced like myself to own one of these at such high mileage.<\/p>\n\n<p>The car was just repainted since the guy\u2019s friend owns a body shop and he wanted to get rid of stone chips and nicks on the paint. He\u2019s the third owner and the 2nd owner owned the car from 08-20. I am in love with the car if I can get the price I want, my only concern is the high milage.
