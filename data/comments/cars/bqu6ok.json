A year ago, I decided to look in to buying a bigger vehicle to replace my small 94 subaru legacy car. The little green car was awesome, just small and slowly having engine problems as it reached its 300k status. I had bought it for $300 a few years back to replace the 98 subaru that blew a transmision at mile 240k. I loved this car for reliability prior to developing the weird enginge tick, but it has nothing my little subaru had. The alll-wheel drive, the head space, and trunk for the dogs to stay on long road trips. I loved that 98 subaru.  <\/p>\n\n<p>I replaced the subaru ( it was a good idea since the engine was starting to give out and no body could identify the reason why) with a 2004 Hyandai Santa Fe V6. This car had the room, easy to drive, low-miles (120k), was under $1500 because it had a wheel rattle due to bad struts. I really did like this car...at first. But beside the easy drive and reliable engine, everything went to shit. The speedometer did not read right. Gas meter was off\/non-existent. A\/C never worked. Stereo was shit after a few months. We fixed the struts, but the noise was still there. POS kept falling apart despite the fact that I still drove the shit out of it and generally loved\/defended the car.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Atleast untill the transmission gave out at only 160k miles and 1 year of usage. I was LIVID. This left me with no car, and no $$ to buy a new reliable car. I did the research on this fucking car, and still it burnt me.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>So....That&#39;s my story. I am currently waiting for an amount of money to come in with my student loan (My only option for a car). I intend to use the money towards a sizable down payment, or for an entirely new car. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>My Questions Are:<\/strong> <\/p>\n\n<p>What type of car in my price range of 3k &amp; under (bought), or 3k - 10k  (dealership) would you recommend for someone like me?<\/p>\n\n<p>Would getting another 1998 or older Subaru with Low Miles be an answer, or should I stay away from the older vehicles even though they do have a good reputation (plus, my two were awesome)<\/p>\n\n<p>I need decent space without sacrificing the fuel. I would LOVE to get AWD again, but it isn&#39;t 100% needed. I do have a passion for Subaru&#39;s for their space yet basic off-road ability, but I understand that the 2000-2010 Subarus all have the same engine gasket problems. The 00-10 years are within my price range, but I am not willing to take the risk of them cracking a head\/leaving me without a car.<\/p>\n<\/div>","12":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: California, USA.\nPrice: $0-30k\nLease or buy: either\nUsed\nType: Sports car, preferably coup\u00e8\nMust haves: straight six or V8\nTransmission: prefer manual\nIntended use: i will daily drive a &quot;weekend toy&quot; lol. living on the edge\nVehicles I&#39;ve considered: E92 BMW M3\n1st vehicle?: currently own E46 M3\nNo warranty needed\nPrefer not to do minor work\nCan&#39;t do major work<\/p>\n<\/div>","13":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Location: Washington State<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Price range:<\/strong> 25-32k  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Lease or Buy: Buy<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>New or used: New or Used year 2016-2020<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Type of vehicle:<\/strong> Seden or Hatchback  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Must haves:<\/strong> None  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc): Auto<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Intended use:<\/strong> Every day car  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: 2017 Audi A3, 2019 Honda civic Hatchback, 2019 Volkswagen GLI<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Is this your 1st vehicle: No<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you need a Warranty: Yes<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> Yes  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> No<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<\/div>","14":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Location:<\/strong> Nashville, TN (can also purchase in Chicago, IL and drive to Nashville)<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Price range:<\/strong> 25-30k<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Lease or Buy:<\/strong> Buy  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>New or used:<\/strong> Opting used because of particular model<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Type of vehicle:<\/strong> Coupe\/hatchback  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Must haves:<\/strong> AWD<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc):<\/strong> Auto<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Intended use:<\/strong> Daily Driver<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered:<\/strong> BMW 4 Series variations<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Is this your 1st vehicle:<\/strong> No, currently own a 2004 Acura MDX<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you need a Warranty:<\/strong> Yes<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> (fluids, alternator, battery, brake pads etc) No, but willing to learn.

I am hoping to get some advice from an experienced mechanic but any opinions or perspectives are appreciated. I am commenting here because my post was rejected by the mods. All the information is below, thanks!<\/p>\n\n<p>I have been driving a 2010 Ford Focus for two years (~50k miles) now that was given to me by my grandfather. He used to work for Ford and bought it right before he retired. He maintained the car well. It is currently at 220k miles and has not check engine light. It may need about $300 in repairs for new engine mounts and belts. The body is not in good condition. The skirts are eroded, some dents and scratched on the car and the front bumper is bolted in.<\/p>\n\n<p>I also recently purchased a 2008 VW Jetta 2.5L with 145k miles. I bought it from a coworker of my mothers who was the only owner. He said he kept up on oil changes and took it to a VW dealer for repairs. It is in good condition. Some minor body damage. I think it needs new rear shocks, belts and pulleys. Including everything, I will have spent $2500 on that car.<\/p>\n\n<p>I am stuck between what car I want to sell and which I want to make my daily driver. I do like the Jetta as it has more horsepower and drives smoother. The downside is that parts for VWs tend to be much more expensive than for fords.  I do not mind driving a more beat down car, but am worried about how my focus will hold up. It broke down over the winter and I had to replace the air compressor. The engine shakes quite a bit right now and I am thinking it is some bad engine mounts. My focus does get better gas mileage and I have somewhat of an emotional connection to the car because it was my grandmother\u2019s before she passed.<\/p>\n\n<p>I would like an unbiased opinion about what option would be best for me financially. I am in college so money is a big concern for me right now. What car company is general more reliable in your experience? If I was to sell my Jetta I would repair all the body damage and would like to get $3500-$4000. If I were to keep the Jetta as a daily driver I would repair the engine mounts on my Focus and hopefully get $1500-$1700 selling it. Does this price range seem appropriate for the condition of the cars? <\/p>\n\n<p>Any opinions or advice is greatly appreciated, thanks<\/p>\n<\/div>","41":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: USA, NE Pennsylvania<\/p>\n\n<p>Price Range:$5,000~$14,000<\/p>\n\n<p>Used\/New: Doesn\u2019t matter<\/p>\n\n<p>Buy\/Lease: Buy<\/p>\n\n<p>Type of Vehicle: Sedan\/SUV\/Truck<\/p>\n\n<p>Must Haves: AWD\/4-Wheel, Fuel efficient, CDPlayer<\/p>\n\n<p>Wants but not needed: Back-Up camera, Blue Tooth<\/p>\n\n<p>Transmission: Automatic <\/p>\n\n<p>Use: Daily Driver on Pot hole riddles roads and dirt roads<\/p>\n\n<p>Vehicles Considered: Subaru, Jeep<\/p>\n\n<p>1st Vehicle?: No but first of this purchase size(biggest previous purchase was $3300)<\/p>\n\n<p>Warranty: Would be nice but not deal breaker<\/p>\n\n<p>Minor work: Battery, Brakes, Rotors, Oil, filters\nMajor Work: None(rather a professional do it)<\/p>\n\n<p>Additional Notes: This daily driver will usually do 70miles a day on Pot hole riddles roads and other days the same on combination of previous and dirt roads.

A vehicle that I could do anything in decently, and still have it be an excellent daily driver. Something that was nice, but I also, paradoxically, didn&#39;t have to worry about. It&#39;s a fucking pipe dream and I know it.<\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m so pissed at myself for trading my truck for that godforsaken car, and I&#39;ll probably forever hate japanese cars and might even forget being a car enthusiast over this shit. I&#39;m at a fucking loss and depressed to boot. If I&#39;m going to be more specific, I at least don&#39;t want a &quot;stripper&quot; like a chevy spark (I drove one, it was terrible and noise and low quality all around), but I don&#39;t even know if it&#39;s worth it to ask for anything more.<\/p>\n\n<p>My ideal vehicle would be a solid performance platform with about a 10lb\/hp or lower ratio, less than 3700 pounds with a full interior, extra sound deadening, and an audio build, a manual transmission, rwd, with an enthusiast engine that had a hefty QUALITY aftermarket support and was simple and easy to work on, and, after all is said and done (mods included) might still get at least 20MPG combined, preferably 25.<\/p>\n\n<p>The rest of the car would also have such support (no spec-d type bullshit being the only options left on the market) as well as an interior that isn&#39;t dated, or, would at least be reasonably adaptable to make it look newer.
