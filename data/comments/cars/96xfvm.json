While there is nothing wrong with the car and I actually quite like it I am ready for something new.  I usually keep my cars around 3 years until I get bored of them.  The things I do not like about my WRX are the following:<\/p>\n\n<p>The engine\/power band - I HATE how it runs out of steam up top.  I have a stage 1 map currently on it which fixes the rev hang and does open it up a bit more up top but I really wish it produced peak power at the top of the RPM range.  While it is nice to have low\/mid range torque I really miss being able to open up a car in the higher RPM and have it pull hard all the way to redline begging for more.  The new WRX 2.0 motors just arn&#39;t meant for that with the small, stock turbo and I have no desire to heavily mod my daily driver.<\/p>\n\n<p>Suspension: - I find myself driving a lot more for work and while I really like the suspension on the WRX, it is an all of nothing deal.  On highway\/longer trips I really wish I had the option to soften out the suspension and made it more comfortable\/lazy instead of being rough\/raw all the time.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Interior - Its a WRX and the 15 models didn&#39;t have the infotainment system.  Would be nice to have an overall nicer interior with a better sounds system and technology.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>CARS I AM CONSIDERING:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>MK7.5 Golf R<\/strong> - I like this a lot but overall it just doesn&#39;t really excite me.  The 2018 models have the DCC as standard and they are very well equipped technology\/interior wise for the price.  Downside is the engine\/haldex AWD system.  Engine has sort of the same issue as the WRX - it runs out of steam up top and just isn&#39;t really that engaging to drive - even less so than my WRX in my opinion.  I found the suspension\/steering to be pretty numb as well and it felt a little over-refined for my taste.  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Audi RS3<\/strong> - This is pretty much exactly what I want in a daily driver but it is also the most expensive to purchase and insure.  The interior is top notch, it has the Audi magnetic ride control and loads of texh including the virtual cockpit.  The engine is a BEAST.  They really let me open it up on the test drive and this car is just in a way different league than all the others I drove.  On comfort mode it is actually comfortable and you could easily crush miles in it.  The engine just sounds sooooo goooood.  That 5 cylinder is infamous for good reason, it just flat our rips and pulls HARD all the way to the redline begging for more! Add in the exhaust burbles\/cracks\/pops and it really does truly sound exotic.  As an enthusiat, just owning an RS car would be amazing as I have lusted over AMG\/RS\/M cars since I can remember.   <em>Two downsides<\/em> - We don&#39;t get the sport-back version and it only comes in the 7 speed dual clutch gearbox.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Porsche Macan S<\/strong> - awesome and extremely versatile but I would feel like a douche riding around in a Porsche Macan.  I feel like as an auto enthusiast my first Porsche purchase should be something like a Cayman, not a crossover SUV.  <\/p>\n\n<p>For the Audi RS3 I found a dealer willing to make a really good deal on one.  Most are selling for exactly MSRP but they are willing to take 3% off MSRP.  I could buy a used Audi RS3 and save 5-8K but not sure if that is worth it?  I worry about resale on cars like this where their are multiple owners over a short period of time and think a one owner, fully stock one would catch a better value than one that already has had 2 previous owners?<\/p>\n<\/div>","12":"<div class=\"md\"><p>In Alberta, Canada.

I&#39;ve had such a great time with my current Mazda 3 (whose lease is up in October), that I want to just get the same car and continue paying a low monthly lease payment as I have been. However, my dad who is the unofficial car guru of our family, is trying to push me towards getting a Mercedes CLA class because his reasoning is that: 1.) It is a safer car than the Mazda 2.) The service is better 3.) Usual snobbery of why Mercedes are better cars than Mazdas. <\/p>\n\n<p>However, I asked another friend about this and he explained that although Mercedes can be a better make overall, it really depends on the vehicle and model that you&#39;re looking at. For some models, the extra money you would be spending to afford a Mercedes doesn&#39;t mean that you&#39;re getting a significantly better car for the price. <\/p>\n\n<p>He explained that there are some Mercedes models on the lower end of the price spectrum that aren&#39;t superior to the Mazda 3 at all and could end up being worse in terms of mileage, quality, and price, all of which are important to me. <\/p>\n\n<p>So, I ask you, experts (and thank you for taking the time by the way): If you had to choose between the Mazda 3 and the Mercedes CLA, which would you choose based on these priorities? Are there any alternatives that I could consider? <\/p>\n\n<p>EDIT:: CLA not CLK.
