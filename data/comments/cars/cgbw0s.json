with 20k miles , when new ones are retailing around 30k (MSRP is 35k but nobody is paying that). That immediately caught my attention. 240 HP, 9 speed transmission, with a big trunk, pretty attractive ... seems perfect, and yet they are depreciating like crazy. I know Buick is... Buick, and nobody is buying any sedan not named corolla or civic, but this is absurd. Do they randomly catch on fire?<\/p>\n\n<p>After some more research, I realized that every used Sportback I could find is a former rental. I rent cars often and treat them as well as my own, but I know most people do not. That and the absurd depreciation is giving me a pause, but I am still not sure what other cars I could buy for that little money that would offer the performance, technology, and reliability that this brings to the table. I am sure I will be killed in the resale, but I am not planning on selling for ~5 years.<\/p>\n\n<p>I am not too sure what the point of this post is, I think I just wanna gather some opinions, and see if I get good arguments against this purchase that would make me change my mind.<\/p>\n<\/div>","3":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I am curious what <a href=\"\/r\/cars\">\/r\/cars<\/a> would buy for $60k for pure driving pleasure.

Another would be automatic rev matching since my heel-toe is shite. <\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc): manual preferred for engsgement.

I want something nice and new that doesn&#39;t struggle getting to 70mph getting on the highway.<\/p>\n\n<p>I wanted something awd\/4wd for the winter so initially I checked out a bunch of trucks and the awd charger\/Challenger. The trucks were fun and they have a lot of utility but I don&#39;t think it really had the &quot;cool&quot; factor I was looking for. Plus the price didn&#39;t seem to give me as much as what a car would. I checked out some of the Subarus and none really caught my eye. I really did not like the chargers when I test drove them. I tried the Camaro and it was better, but I really loved the mustang for it&#39;s looks and how it drove. With it being rwd I would be using it only half the year though. With the c8 recently announced I was really thinking of saving up the extra 10k for that instead though because, damn, it looked nice to me and I&#39;ve always wanted a corvette. <\/p>\n\n<p>Idk I&#39;m just not sure what to do and was just hoping to bounce a few ideas off people. Everyone around me just tell me to buy another used junker. <\/p>\n\n<p>I really don&#39;t need a car that goes 0-60 in .1 seconds and I&#39;m not tracking them. Itl be mostly for my enjoyment and to look nice. So with that I was thinking the 4 cylinder mustang would be a good match for the lower price. I was looking at the gt but again for the price it would come to I would probably rather have the c8... And then the whole truck SUV thing. I guess I&#39;m struggling with a car\/truck to find for a value that seems worth it too. Any other cars I should look into?<\/p>\n<\/div>","102":"<div class=\"md\"><p><strong>Location:<\/strong> Midwest US<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Price range:<\/strong> 25-40k<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Lease or Buy:<\/strong> Buy preferred<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>New or used:<\/strong> New preferred<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Type of vehicle:<\/strong> Budget sports car<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Must haves:<\/strong> Fun factor during daily driving for performance enthusiast.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc):<\/strong> Manual preferred, but good DCT is okay.

I&#39;m primarily looking for something fun that will make a ~15 mile commute enjoyable. While &quot;don&#39;t buy new&quot; is always good advice, I&#39;m mostly looking for the peace of mind in terms of that extra reliability. I&#39;m leaning towards either the Miata-RF or Veloster N because these cars feel like the ones that are at a good place in their lifecycle. The WRX\/STI not having a hatch option leaves it unimpressive to me. The BRZ\/86 and Golf GTI\/R are rumored to be getting refreshed in the next two years or so with a good horsepower bump (and a major interior update in the golf). <\/p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;<\/p>\n\n<p>Most of what I&#39;m looking for is the emotional connection of buying a car that won&#39;t leave me feeling like I really should have waited one more model year before buying. Yeah, new things happen all the time, but the recent horsepower bump in the Miata and the overall execution of the Veloster N make it seem like this model year will be a decision I&#39;m happy with for a long time to come, while I feel like I&#39;d regret the BRZ\/86\/GTI in a two years when a new generation is out. That said, I think I&#39;d probably be happy with anything on the list, but I&#39;d love other enthusiast opinions.<\/p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;<\/p>\n\n<p>That said, I&#39;m not all about the numbers, but more about the overall driving experience. Where I live the roads are drawn with rulers and right angles basically everywhere though, so good handling might not provide as many smiles as a better 0-60. While I can afford something like the Type R, STI, or Golf R, the budget savings of something like the Veloster N is appealing. Also I have no garage access at this time, so getting a soft-top miata can&#39;t really be the answer.<\/p>\n<\/div>","103":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Brooklyn ny <\/p>\n\n<p>Not sure if I should lease or buy<\/p>\n\n<p>Coming out of lease with a 2016 Jeep Grand Cherokee. <\/p>\n\n<p>Current payment 400<\/p>\n\n<p>Just offered 1500 down and 385 a month lease on a 2020 Cherokee overland <\/p>\n\n<p>Really only looking to spend 300<\/p>\n\n<p>Prefer a truck cause i have a 80 pound dog I like to tote around.
