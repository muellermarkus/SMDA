Also something with pretty decent reliability would be great. <\/p>\n\n<p>This&#39;ll be my daily driver, and kind of first car. I&#39;m perfectly happy to do minor work myself, and some more major stuff but anything too bad or complicated and it&#39;ll go to the garage which I&#39;m fine with, my best friend was a mechanic for 5 years and he has a lot of friends in that industry still that can get things sorted for not much more than the price of the part, \u00a350 and a can of irn bru. <\/p>\n\n<p>So the two cars I&#39;ve mainly been looking at right now are a 2013 ford fiesta 1.0 ecoboost, and a 2008 BMW 320i, both with under 70k miles on the clock. They are the same for me to insure, because I&#39;ve actually had a car insured on provisional license racking up some nice no claims bonus for the last 2 years that for a few reasons I couldn&#39;t pass my test and drive properly until now (theory test booked, shortly after will be the practical so next 6-8 months realistically), and that car has blown up. Also the ecoboost has a turbo which immediately makes it more expensive to insure, I got a lil dinger tucked away in my pants which increases insurance, and I&#39;m 20 which means that a lot of people my age have got fiestas and smashed the tits off them which increases insurance for fiestas.  <\/p>\n\n<p>For the last while I&#39;ve been paying provisional insurance and tax on the car I wasn&#39;t driving, plus a monthly bus ticket. With the insurance and tax of each car they equal about the same as that cost I&#39;ll only be worse off by the cost of petrol, and I&#39;ll only drive 100-120 miles a week with the very rare longer journey so that&#39;s not too much of a worry either. <\/p>\n\n<p>Obviously I&#39;ll be paying quite a bit more for petrol in the bmw, and it is quite a bit bigger so actually learning to drive and park it will be a tad more difficult to start but I&#39;m not too worried about that. The fiesta seems like the smarter choice on the surface because it&#39;s smaller, I don&#39;t have to pay tax on it, it&#39;ll only sip at fuel and it&#39;s a fair bit newer, also it&#39;s a ford and they&#39;re everywhere so parts will be cheaper. However, I want this car to last for the next 5-10 years with it being looked after properly, and that little 1L fiesta engine will begin to feel quite slow and boring, also the bmw is rwd which adds to the fun and it&#39;s also just much prettier than the fiesta, plus that famous German reliability. <\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve found a few options for each that are withing budget, less than 75k miles and all seem fairly well looked after, there&#39;s one 320i that I&#39;m leaning most towards because it comes with Bluetooth and satnav options selected and I just prefer the bmw, but it&#39;ll depend on how it is in person and if there&#39;s anything wrong with it really. <\/p>\n\n<p>Mostly what I&#39;m asking for is other options that&#39;ll fit what I&#39;m looking for really, the fun factor is fairly important to me (although I&#39;ll be fairly easily impressed coming from a blown up Punto), reliability, and ideally not crazy insurance (petrol turbos probably best avoided in most cases but I&#39;ll be happy to get a quote for anything). Also, opinions on what you&#39;d do in this situation. <\/p>\n\n<p>As a side note, I am seriously tempted by an mx5, but the two seats would be an issue for me, but at the same time mx5, but I will often be ferrying a few people around at a time so I really can&#39;t lol. <\/p>\n\n<p>Any help is appreciated.<\/p>\n<\/div>","30":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: Michigan<\/p>\n\n<p>Price Range: 15-35k<\/p>\n\n<p>Lease or Buy: Buy<\/p>\n\n<p>New or used: either works<\/p>\n\n<p>Type of vehicle: sports car or fun to drive car <\/p>\n\n<p>Must haves: manual transmission, 4 seats (kids 11, 6), awd or rwd, look sporty<\/p>\n\n<p>Desired transmission: manual<\/p>\n\n<p>Intended use: Weekend car and sometimes drive to work<\/p>\n\n<p>Cars considered: Camaro and Mustang <\/p>\n\n<p>1st vehicle: no<\/p>\n\n<p>Do you need warranty: Nice to have but not necessarily <\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do minor work: Yes, I can change the blinker fluid!\ud83d\ude05<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do major work: No<\/p>\n\n<p>Additional notes: love that v8 sound, but probably wouldn\u2019t use all that power.<\/p>\n<\/div>","31":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: Orange County, CA<br\/>\nPrice range: 70k<br\/>\nLease or Buy: Lease<br\/>\nNew or used: New<br\/>\nVehicles you&#39;ve already considered: I am between C43 AMG sedan vs BMW M440i xDrive Gran Coupe<\/p>\n\n<p>They are around the same price.
