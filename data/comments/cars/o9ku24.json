My commute to work is a 10 minute walk, no kids or spouse to worry about, gas mileage isn&#39;t a concern, and I have access to an SUV for any thing that might come up. <\/p>\n\n<p>I owned an <a href=\"https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/TIjAijf\">ND2 Miata<\/a> from October 2020-March 2021, where it was promptly totaled by a lifted Silverado rear-ending me in Seattle. Now that the dust is settled, I&#39;m in the market again. I don&#39;t really know if I want another Miata; it was a pretty fun car, but... kinda underwhelming. The engine was fairly uninspiring, it was hard to drive the car casually without getting some sort of jerk or hitch from the clutch\/transmission, I barely fit in it, and... I dunno. Just kinda missing <em>something<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n<p>My car before the Miata was a 2005 RX-8 Shinka edition, which I drove until it died (at, y&#39;know, 75k miles because rotary). Driving it was an absolute joy and I miss it, but it was fairly slow and the constant small issues with its ignition drove me insane.<\/p>\n\n<p>Which brings me to the two cars I&#39;m considering the most: An FD RX-7 &amp; a Civic Type-R. The FD is my dream car; I have a poster of it in my garage, I have an RX-7 diecast, I dream in triangles. I&#39;m just worried I&#39;m going to have a &quot;never meet your heroes&quot; moment if I spring for it. After all, it&#39;s almost 30 years old at this point.<\/p>\n\n<p>The CTR seems pretty fun, comes with a warranty, and I imagine I&#39;ll probably have less long-term issues with it. I wish I could test drive it, but not a single dealership near me has one in-stock and I imagine a 21-year old asking to test drive their halo car would set off an alarm.<\/p>\n<\/div>","84":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: Long Island, NY <\/p>\n\n<p>Price range: Around $25k (Lease payments under 300\/month <\/p>\n\n<p>Lease or Buy: Lease <\/p>\n\n<p>New or used: New <\/p>\n\n<p>Type of vehicle: Crossover, SUV <\/p>\n\n<p>Must haves: Android Auto, Decent backseat space for kids eventually, push to start <\/p>\n\n<p>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc): Would love Manual but know not likely<\/p>\n\n<p>Intended use: Daily Driver <\/p>\n\n<p>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: Mazda CX-30, Honda HR-V, Kia Soul, Toyota C-HR\/RAV4, Hyundai Kona, Jeep Renegade <\/p>\n\n<p>Is this your 1st vehicle: No <\/p>\n\n<p>Do you need a Warranty: basic is fine <\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle: (fluids, alternator, battery, brake pads etc) no <\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle: (engine and transmission, timing belt\/chains, body work, suspension etc ) no <\/p>\n\n<p>Additional Notes: appreciate any advice from current owners of the cars listed!!<\/p>\n<\/div>","85":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[gel\u00f6scht]<\/p>\n<\/div>","86":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Hi everyone,<\/p>\n\n<p>My wife and I are looking to buy a used car in the bay area (our first car in America) and after test driving some Prius models, decided to go for an SUV because I&#39;m a big guy.<\/p>\n\n<p>Our budget is flexible -- we have looked at cars ranging from 5k to 20k.<\/p>\n\n<p>Currently we have shortlisted 2 cars and would love any inputs:<\/p>\n\n<p>A 2014 Honda CR-V with 72k miles\n* Lowest trim (we&#39;re not thrilled about the interiors and the features are basic)\n* Extremely well-maintained\n* Great cosmetic condition except for one dent (which we don&#39;t care about so much)\n* Drives great!
