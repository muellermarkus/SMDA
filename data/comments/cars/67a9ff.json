(This is my question)<\/p>\n\n<p>Intended Use: Daily Driver<\/p>\n\n<p>I just recently bought a 2017 Dodge Challenger SXT Plus after fantasizing about a Challenger for years. I absolutely love the car, it&#39;s comfortable, fun to drive, and I was very impressed with the new interiors. However, shortly after buying the car, I unexpectantly got an offer for a new job that is too good to pass up. The problem is, the job is in the mountains of western Maryland, which get a lot of snow in the winter. If I had known this was a possibility in advance, I likely would have invested in the GT version that is AWD instead of the RWD.\nNow I&#39;m trying to decide what to do. Are RWD really unsafe to drive in the snow? I had driven my last car, a RWD Hyundai Tiburon in winter conditions before, although very carefully and in an area that didn&#39;t get frequent snow. I&#39;ve only put about 600 miles on the Challenger. Is it safer to drive in the snow due its weight helping with traction or does that just put it in a fishtail easier? Should I consider investing in a second, cheap beater truck to drive when the weather is poor? Go back to the dealer and try to exchange it for a GT Challenger or Jeep or something and hope to not take too much of a loss?\nI&#39;m over the moon excited about the job opportunity, as well as the car, but not sure if the two work well together.

While the car still runs well for now (no water got into the engine, thankfully), my mechanic told me that because of the ECU getting wet, I might see gremlins pop up. I&#39;m in university, and I can&#39;t afford anything amazing (for reference, the car is a 2007 Saturn Ion). I do need to get around though, and if the car starts acting up and the repair bill gets too high, I will have to purchase another vehicle. As I stated, my mechanic is super trustworthy, never overbills me, and is blatantly honest on what needs to get done and what I don&#39;t need to take care of right away. He knows GM vehicles best, and despite the circle jerk on this thread for crapping on them, I find them particularly reliable. I really appreciate anything pointing me in the right direction, and frankly I just need a safe reliable car to get from A to B.

For a while i have been coveting the Infiniti G series and this one is pretty much exactly the one I want, (Black int\/ext, coupe, sport, low miles, etc.) but I&#39;m just not sure If it&#39;s a good idea to spend 14k on a car that&#39;s already almost 10 years old... especially when I can get a different one that is only 2 years old for less. I have heard mazda6s are fun and I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll like the car, but I just don&#39;t want to feel like I&#39;ve missed out on the driving experience I&#39;ve imagined for over a year now.\nI&#39;m going to start grad school in the fall so money will be a factor.

Having it break down every five seconds would be counterproductive to this.  I&#39;m most interested in cars that have good gas mileage, hence the prior consideration of a Prius.  Again, I&#39;m looking at a fairly tight long-term budget, so low cost-to-own is important.  I don&#39;t much care about handling or performance as long as it&#39;s safe and doesn&#39;t have issues getting to highway speeds.

I am not averse at all going back any number of years as long as the car has front airbags.<br\/>\n  Basically, I&#39;m looking for older cars not on my radar with AWD and good gas mileage. I am willing to give up some mpg for more comfortable seats. When I drive my girlfriend&#39;s &#39;13 Focus SE for more than about 45 minutes, I start to feel very uncomfortable. Even in my Tundra, this sets in after extended driving but it is fine for the less-than-an-hour commute I&#39;m planning on. If I could afford it, I would be buying a newer luxury hybrid AWD with nice comfy seats. Alternatively, would not be opposed to retrofitted seats in high mpg commuter. Looking for input on comfort comparisons on the vehicles I&#39;ve noted as considered above. I suspect the Legacy has much nicer seats than the Impreza and that the 400h has the best possible seats of this bunch. Yes? No?  Seat comfort is really the only thing giving me hesitation. Keep in mind that if I go the Subaru route, it will be an older one most likely, like an 03 to 08 model.  <\/p>\n<\/div>","132":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: Toronto, Canada<\/p>\n\n<p>Price range: ~$45k<\/p>\n\n<p>New or used: Used<\/p>\n\n<p>Type of vehicle: Sport sedan<\/p>\n\n<p>Must haves: Four doors and be fun to drive.<\/p>\n\n<p>Desired transmission: Auto\/DCT<\/p>\n\n<p>Intended use: Daily driver (only commute 1000km a month max)<\/p>\n\n<p>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: BMW E90 M3, Audi S3\/S4, BMW F30 Wagon (w\/ M-sport+xdrive).<\/p>\n\n<p>Is this your 1st vehicle: No.<\/p>\n\n<p>Does the vehicle need to have a warranty: Ideally, but no.<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle: Yes.<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle: No.<\/p>\n\n<p>Additional Notes:  Prefer 2011 or newer.<\/p>\n<\/div>","133":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: nyc area<\/p>\n\n<p>Price range: less than 10k<\/p>\n\n<p>New or used: usef<\/p>\n\n<p>Type of vehicle:  Sedan<\/p>\n\n<p>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc): auto<\/p>\n\n<p>Intended use: (Daily Driver<\/p>\n\n<p>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: is350 g35\/37 3rd gen tl<\/p>\n\n<p>Is this your 1st vehicle: no<\/p>\n\n<p>Does the vehicle need to have a warranty: no<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Minor work on your : yes<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle: no<\/p>\n\n<p>Fun car decently reliable with 4 doors <\/p>\n<\/div>","134":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Ca, around 25k, used or new(if used under 20k miles prefer), daily, don&#39;t know shit about doing maintenance on own car.
