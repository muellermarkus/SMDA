I need a comfortable everyday runabout SUV. My everyday commute is around 150km long (vv), consisting of motorways and extremely crowded, less-than-optimal streets (hence why I need an SUV). Comfort, refinement, and amenities takes top priority here, handling being further down the list. I currently have an SUV, a Honda HR-V, but I&#39;m unimpressed by its lack of refinement, space, and most critically, oomph (1,5l, 110hp CVT).  So I&#39;m selling it for a larger SUV. <\/p>\n\n<p>My heart wants the new Renault Koleos: 170hp 2,5l, CBU from Korea, standard leather seats, tons of standard equipment including an R-LINK 2 OBU with CarPlay + 12-way Bose sound system(!) for 465mio. It&#39;s got pretty much all the option boxes ticked. It&#39;s very comfortable too. Also very good looking. However it sells for tiny amounts in Indonesia so selling it will be tough. If I buy one, I&#39;d have to keep it around for a long time, 6-7 years.<\/p>\n\n<p>So my rational mind screams for the new CR-V. It&#39;s MUCH more common than the Renault (so much better resale value+ demand), has a more powerful engine (193hp vs 170), and also seats more passengers, for 495mio. But it&#39;s dull and predictable. Equipment-wise it has less standard equipment than the Renault. It rides harder than the Renault. It&#39;s not CBU, being locally assembled, so build quality is worse than the Renault). But it&#39;s a safe bet.<\/p>\n\n<p>If money&#39;s no object then I&#39;d go for the Mazda CX-5 at 565mio, but it has a limited range of dealerships and workshops around where I live (even less so than Renault).<\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve seen some Audi Q3s retail used at around 370mio. For that much I can get one with around 15000km on the clock, but comes equipped with a 211hp turbo 2-litre, plus AWD. It&#39;s smaller, yes, but also a premium, German-made car. Which also means that the road tax, despite being a small SUV, costs as much as the bigger SUVs on the list here.<\/p>\n\n<p>Alternatively I&#39;ve been offered Hyundai Tucsons and Kia Sportages by my local dealers for much less than the Renault and Honda. MSRP is at 380-395mio new for these things at 2017 price , but I&#39;ve been offered new ones from MY2016 with a 50mio discounts, bringing the price down to a very tantalising 330mio for a new, CBU SUV. These cars though are smaller and nowhere near as well equipped, and also tough to sell.<\/p>\n\n<p>Thoughts?<\/p>\n<\/div>","29":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Opinions on a 2014-15 X5 i35?

I love diesel and feel a bit more comfortable with accidents in a Mercedes. But the repair costs are a bit of a concern. I&#39;ve looked at other diesel SUVs but the Land Rover layout of a Range Rover reminds me too much of my childhood in the worst ways. I haven&#39;t been able to find many mid-range branded diesel SUVs for sale. My mother has a Lexus that&#39;s been cheap to repair and just goes and goes, but my grandparent&#39;s claim their Lexus SUV has been &quot;more expensive to service than our many Mercedesesesesseseses&quot;. I know I&#39;m name dropping labels left right and centre, but I don&#39;t necessarily need luxury, I&#39;m just unfamilar with other brands since my family mostly loves Euro cars\/ MB. <\/p>\n\n<p>Is this your 1st vehicle: No, I&#39;ve had a 2001 220 Mercedes that just... .... hemorrhaged money and a really great 2008 C250 CDI Mercedes that I loved and wanted to keep, but needed to sell to move to CAD.<\/p>\n\n<p>Does the vehicle need to have a warranty: IDK.<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle: (fluids, alternator, battery, water pump, brake pad etc) Nah.<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle: (engine and transmission rebuild, timing belt\/chains, body work etc ) Nope.<\/p>\n\n<p>Additional Notes: We are two girls less than 5&quot;7 without spawn who dream of a car that we can easily drive to work on a daily basis and also with a suitable fuel efficiency and boot space to take on holidays, so more of a mid-size SUV. I prefer something from about 2008 and earlier. My gf really loves Mazdas but the good looking Mazdas I&#39;ve seen on websites have consistently been more expensive than the Mercedes (probably due to cheaper servicing costs and higher demand). I don&#39;t mind factoring a bit of extra servicing in if I know I can make it up in fuel economy. <\/p>\n<\/div>","118":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: NSW australia<\/p>\n\n<p>Price range: $4,000-$10,000<\/p>\n\n<p>New or used: used<\/p>\n\n<p>Type of vehicle: Subaru Impreza<\/p>\n\n<p>Must haves: Nothing that&#39;s not standard on a post 20000 model.<\/p>\n\n<p>Desired transmission: Auto (essential, crucify me)<\/p>\n\n<p>Intended use: Daily driver, fun.<\/p>\n\n<p>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: Other imprezas<\/p>\n\n<p>Is this your 1st vehicle: No<\/p>\n\n<p>Does the vehicle need to have a warranty: No<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle: Yes<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle: No<\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m basically tossing up between a 2nd generation impreza station wagon and 3rd generation impreza hatchback.<\/p>\n<\/div>","119":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: Atlanta, GA<\/p>\n\n<p>Price range: $15-24K<\/p>\n\n<p>New or used: Used<\/p>\n\n<p>Type of vehicle: Car\/Sedan - would consider a coupe<\/p>\n\n<p>Must haves: Fuel efficient is big - Atlanta traffic is no joke!<\/p>\n\n<p>Desired transmission: Currently have a manual and love it, but about to start an hour+ commute in horrible traffic<\/p>\n\n<p>Intended use: Daily driver<\/p>\n\n<p>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: None as of yet<\/p>\n\n<p>Is this your 1st vehicle: No<\/p>\n\n<p>Does the vehicle need to have a warranty: No<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle: Can, but live in a high-rise building and probably won&#39;t be able to<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle: No<\/p>\n\n<p>Additional Notes:  Currently have an &#39;08 Infiniti G35 Sport Sedan 6MT with about 110k miles.
