I\u2019m getting close to making up my mind, but could use some guidance.<\/strong> <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Background:<\/strong> I\u2019m a young physician currently driving a 2005 Jeep Grand Cherokee. Love it, but it\u2019s mostly become the dog\u2019s car and the AC has kicked the bucket for the second time (previously replaced the Compressor and Condenser 4yr ago). I\u2019m gonna keep it but am looking for a different daily driver. We want kids, so I\u2019ve got to get something fun now and will a little practical in the near future. I do like having something a little different, so I\u2019m looking at a less common or luxury sport sedan.

Please 1) give your thoughts on these, including pricing. 2) Your opinion if I should wait for true price drops on 2018s, 3) feel free to give any other suggestions, even off the wall considerations I might have missed. <\/p>\n\n<p>1) Audi A5 Sportback 2018 new (Premier Plus with Nav and B&amp;O sound system) - <em>$47k<\/em>- Has really impressed me and getting harder to look away from. The driver virtual cockpit is awesome, and the B&amp;O sound is next to none as stock. Drive is smooth but super powerful even as base A5 <\/p>\n\n<p>2) Alfa Romeo Guilia Ti RWD 2018 new (mid level package with Nav)- <em>~$43-50k-<\/em> My original #1, super fun to drive, but not as smooth and a little smaller that some other options. Also still worried about Italian reliability. <\/p>\n\n<p>3) Maserati Ghibli RWD 2016 20k miles (Nav)- ~<em>$44k, but I could get them down some.<\/em> \u2013 This is the wildcard they showed me when looking at Alfa. Had no idea it would be an option for me, and the ride is fun if only for the muffler purr. I like that it\u2019s already taken its initial depreciation hit, but not sure how I feel about that next level elite stigma I\u2019d get. Is this car worth it?<\/p>\n\n<p>4) Kia Stinger Premium vs GT1 2018- <em>Fairly priced<\/em>. \u2013 I like this car, but still feel like it should be a little less when you drive the A5 package at the same price. Also, Kia dealership customer service has been less than impressive. <\/p>\n\n<p>5) Jaguar XE premier plus 2018- ~<em>$45k-<\/em> Considering the other options, the Jag has fallen back for me, but always been a favorite of mine. <\/p>\n\n<p>6) Jaguar XF premier 2018, used 6k miles- <em>$40k<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>7) BMW 4 series gran coupe 2016 &lt;15k miles- <em>~$48k-<\/em> Also fallen off as late. Some due to price, some due to seeing so many BMW here. <\/p>\n\n<p>8) Others I\u2019ve considered: <em>Lexus ES, Merc C300, Lincoln MKZ.<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>Thanks so much for your help. I\u2019m close to calling up Audi for that A5 sportback, just want to make sure I\u2019m doing the right thing, and I\u2019ve always enjoyed this sub&#39;s information and candor.

So would probably get annoying quick as a daily driver.<\/p>\n\n<p>The other one I considered is an R33\/R34 4 door with the RB25DE (non turbo) equiped with a manual transmission, I already own a R33 GTR and used to own an R33 GTST, It&#39;s not really too heavy(but on the limit), fuel consumption of the non turbo engine is not too high. They&#39;re not to expensive to get with low mileage. But I don&#39;t really have a need for a 4 door Sedan, but I do think it&#39;s a cool car and it&#39;s still being considered.<\/p>\n\n<p>As you maybe can tell I&#39;m really into &quot;JDM&quot; cars and so importing one wouldn&#39;t really be an problem, but it doesn&#39;t have to be JDM!<\/p>\n<\/div>","53":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location - fort lauderdale florida\nPrice range- around 5 thousand\nLooking for- Used cars<\/p>\n\n<p>I am a new driver looking for my first car, i make around 1400 a month so im trying to not get sucked into high payments, i got 2 thousand i can put into a car right now for that and insurance, so far i looked into a dodge charger which was 70k miles at 5500, but right now i see a cadillac 2005 sts v8 with 50,000 miles and its only 1500 dollars.

I&#39;m leaning towards the Alfa because it&#39;s different, sporty, and stunning but the leases seem to be really high right now (and I get FCA employee discounts). I also like the Volvo but fear lease prices are going to be high as well, but love how different the S60 is to other cars on the road.

The appeal of the Sorento is the 3rd row seat to drive my wife, kids and parents somewhere without needing 2 cars, but that happens only 4-5 times a year.  That being said, neither of these are much to look at and they don&#39;t appeal to me on an emotional level nearly as much as a Jeep Wrangler Unlimited, but I know they are far more practical.

Current owner bought in 1996, 77k on odometer but no longer functioning, new GM crate 350 with under 100 miles, new clutch, new gears for 4sp Muncie M20, new exhaust, 4 wheel disc brakes (non power), new interior, 3 year old paint job in Nassau Blue, convertible top but no hardtop. 1965 safety standards - Lap belts only. Has uninstalled Holley FI kit included with car. <\/p>\n\n<p>Cobra - 2012 model from MidStates.  Asking $40k.  Current owner has owned it for 4 years. 427 FE side oiler with 1900 miles on it. Owner put about 1\/2 of them on it. Gets 10 mpg but being 2300lbs with almost 500hp makes this an adult go cart. 5 point racing harnesses. Loud sidepipes. No bumpers. Completely impractical. No door locks, has tonneau cover but no top. But the grins per mile is off the charts. <\/p>\n\n<p>The Corvette is more practical and it can actually be locked out in public.
