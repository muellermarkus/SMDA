For about the first week I was seriously considering getting an early 90&#39;s Japanese import truck\/vans (Hiace) because of how fun they look, amazing capacity, really awesome moon-roofs, and the simple builds make them easy to customize (ie. <em>Carplay<\/em> stereo) but using right-hand-drive would probably make me unhappy fairly quick. I considered trucks\/large SUVs, but then decided I should get some half-decent MPG and be able to park it in my garage (210&quot;). After that I was falling in love with Wranglers and the idea of storage space with the fun of the convertible mode! Then I discovered the noisy highway ride and realized how great my Infiniti was acoustically. Looked at trucks and made another spreadsheet then ultimately decided I want it to fit in my garage (I live in a downtown area). Took a test drive in a base model VW and the speakers were <em>meh<\/em> - again comparing to my M45 sedan&#39;s 14 Bose speakers... So I&#39;m really torn and I can barely prioritize what&#39;s important to me. Easy choice is to get a luxury wagon\/crossover\/suv but to get the cool tech I&#39;m looking at 2017+ which puts them out of my price range. Then even with older luxury cars, changing out the head units with Carplay ones is soooo difficult!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Quick other notes:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><em>LOVE<\/em> to have a digital instrument cluster like the <em>Digital Cockpit<\/em> in the VWs but it&#39;s so hard to search and research which cars have these and which years.

Lately I&#39;ve started going on occasional longer road trips, and while the driver&#39;s seat is relatively comfortable (and spacious, found that to be a bit of an issue on some of my test drives), I&#39;ve found the power a bit lacking (unable to reach the speed limit on some steep sections of highway, for example), and the ride quality at higher speeds isn&#39;t the best either.<\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not really a car enthusiast (so maybe I&#39;m posting this in the wrong place), but I&#39;ve been feeling like getting something newer, and maybe nicer. Right now I&#39;m basically considering only Toyota &amp; Lexus (reliability is only under safety for me, I really don&#39;t want to deal with things breaking, as much as I can avoid it), but maybe I need to be convinced otherwise.<\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m mostly going to use it as a daily driver, and occasionally for trips to go hiking, camping, etc. On that note, I&#39;ve tried once to sleep in my matrix(instead of setting up a tent), and it was just a little bit too small to be comfortable, but I was thinking of maybe using my future vehicle for that as well. I&#39;d usually be riding alone, sometimes with 1 or 2 other passengers.<\/p>\n\n<p>Another thing I&#39;d really like to have is android auto support. I installed an aftermarket unit in my matrix over a year ago, and I don&#39;t want to go back. This is problematic since only the newest \/future Toyota &amp; Lexus models will have this.<\/p>\n\n<p>I started out considering the prius prime, mostly since its a phev, which would allow me to use HOV lanes without a passenger. It was ok, but a bit small, and the engine is kind of weak (by the numbers at least, didn&#39;t have the chance to really stress it). And the HOV lane thing isn&#39;t really worth it in the end Imo. <\/p>\n\n<p>Tried the Camry out right after, and it was...similar. Tried the es350 out a couple of weeks later, and again, I found it hard to notice much difference between it, the Camry, and the prius, driving-wise (es interior was better of course). It could be since I didn&#39;t have much chance to stress them (mostly low speed in the city). Maybe I&#39;m just not very discerning. They were all much better than my matrix though. <\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve never driven anything larger than that rav4, the rx350 idea just came from reading about how comfortable it supposedly is, and I gather it would be safer than a sedan, being bigger? And then the highlander as maybe a cheaper alternative. Those two (along with the 4runner) would be good for sleeping in too (but as the salesman who did the rav4 test drive with me said, I should be thinking about the 350+ days I&#39;m not sleeping in it)<\/p>\n\n<p>And the 4runner because my little brother has an older one, which inspired me with fantasies of off-roading (which would probably remain unfulfilled in any case...).<\/p>\n\n<p>I have the urge to get something nicer, and can afford it, but it&#39;s hard to justify when I can probably keep driving this matrix for another decade.<\/p>\n<\/div>","70":"<div class=\"md\"><ul>\n<li><p><strong>Location:<\/strong> United States, Wisconsin <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Price range:<\/strong> $5000 max. <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Lease or Buy:<\/strong> buy<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>New or used:<\/strong> used<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Type of vehicle:<\/strong> I&#39;d like a coupe.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Must haves:<\/strong> under 100k miles.

Also really want nicer amenities.<\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m really liking the look of the Saab 9-3 Aero. Its a 2006, comes with leather, 250hp, steering wheel controls, sunroof, independent climate control etc. Price for those are around 2800-4000. Looking at the e46 3 series its about the same price and comes with the same amenities. Really looking for insight from anyone who drives a Saab or older high mileage bmw (140,000+) and see how bad actual maintenance costs are. At this point I wouldn&#39;t mind just keeping it for a year then selling it or keeping it longer if I actually like it. I always was told to stay away from European cars but I don&#39;t want to never try it out because of someone else&#39;s opinion. So if you have a funky european car is it worth it worth the cost? I feel like the honda is just lazy and dead unless I rev the shit outta it which I don&#39;t want to do everyday. Also want to look a little more presentable as shallow as that sounds<\/p>\n<\/div>","73":"<div class=\"md\"><p><strong>Location:<\/strong> Germany<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Price range:<\/strong> max. 10000\u20ac prefered 6-8k\u20ac<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Lease or Buy:<\/strong> Buy<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>New or used:<\/strong> Used<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Type of vehicle:<\/strong> Sports\/Sporty Coupe<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Must haves:<\/strong> fun and fast, but fun&gt;fast<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Desired transmission:<\/strong> Manual<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Intended use:<\/strong> Daily Driver<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered:<\/strong> Mazda Mx 5 (Miata), hyundai Coupe, open for suggestions...<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Is this your 1st vehicle:<\/strong> Yes<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you need a Warranty:<\/strong> No<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> Yes<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> No<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Additional Notes:<\/strong> should not have too many horse power because the insurance would be top expensive<\/p>\n<\/div>","74":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Nissan patrol<\/p>\n<\/div>","75":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Location:<\/strong> Utah, USA  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Price range:<\/strong> 5k-8k  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Lease or Buy: Buy<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>New or used: Used<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Type of vehicle:<\/strong> Sedan  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Must haves:<\/strong> Mileage, reliability  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc): Slight preference for manual<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Intended use:<\/strong>  Daily Driver commuter  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: Corolla, Civic, Forte, Optima, Sonata, Elantra<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Is this your 1st vehicle: No<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you need a Warranty: No<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> Yes  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> No  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Additional Notes:<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p>Do my own oil changes, so I&#39;d really prefer something that makes this easier.
