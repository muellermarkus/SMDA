I would definitely want to buy a second hand car because i would not want the pressure of driving around a new car. I have been looking at a Honda Jazz, but i am very unsure.<\/p>\n\n<p>Any advice would be very kindly appreciated<\/p>\n\n<p>Thank you<\/p>\n<\/div>","68":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Specifically looking for a modern car under 80k$ with the &quot;punchy&quot; feeling of the Pontiac Grand Am (~1999).<br\/>\nWe checked out the Tesla Model 3 as it has that well known ~3.5 second acceleration, but we found the acceleration &quot;ramps&quot; slowly at the beginning.<br\/>\nWe&#39;re more so looking for something that immediately &quot;jumps&quot; when the gas pedal is tapped. <\/p>\n\n<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated! I am not a car person so I don&#39;t know what the quality is that causes that &quot;punchy&quot; feeling. <\/p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Location:<\/strong> United States Northeast  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Price range:<\/strong> Below $80,000  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Lease or Buy: Buy<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>New or used: New<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Type of vehicle:<\/strong> Sedan (4 door)  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Must haves:<\/strong> Punchy acceleration (described above)  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc): Auto<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Intended use:<\/strong> Daily driver, fun   <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered:<\/strong> Tesla Model 3, Dodge Dart 2016 (not punchy enough)  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Is this your 1st vehicle: No<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you need a Warranty: No<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> yes  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> no  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Additional Notes: (see above!)<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<\/div>","69":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Great post<\/p>\n<\/div>","70":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Why not a Subaru?
