Mostly looking at the B7RS4 and E39M5 because they are cars that I always wanted, and want to at least own briefly before values get so high I can&#39;t afford it. I&#39;m hoping to buy a low-owner sub-100k mileage example. The Audi seems like a nicer car while I&#39;m on the east coast and have to deal with snowy weather because the awd would make it safer+more fun to drive. Also, the Audi is like 7 inches shorter (but a couple inches wider). I&#39;ve test driven the E39 M5 (with a short shift + muffler delete) and it was a lot of fun. Still need to test drive the RS4.

I only drive on weekends, and sometimes not even every weekend. I am obviously not a person who wants to get into the car market regularly, so dependability is important. The main thing I&#39;m looking at right now is a 2017\/2018 Sonic, as it&#39;s a nice looking sub-compact and reviews note that it&#39;s got uncommonly good highway performance for its class. It&#39;s also got Android Auto which is nice. I just have some concerns about its materials quality and how they will hold up over time. Like the external rear door plastic which seems like the type that would discolor in the sun &amp; elements. I also looked at a used one that had black paint chipping off of a vertical door window border. I have similar reservations about the glossy plastic bar in the front of the Fit, which seems like it could look cheap &amp; trashy after a few years of scratches &amp; wear. I haven&#39;t 100% decided if I want to buy beyond the sub-compact hatch market, but I&#39;ve included some compact options I&#39;ve looked at above as well. I just don&#39;t want to end up in something that I&#39;d hate taking on the highway, and I know what sub-compacts are generally designed for. I&#39;m not a driving enthusiast, but I don&#39;t want to be frustrated with crap performance. After nearly buying one I&#39;ve taken the Prius C off of my list, after becoming convinced that performance would seriously suffer.<\/p>\n<\/div>","34":"<div class=\"md\"><p><strong>Location:<\/strong> Idaho, USA<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Price range:<\/strong> 20-30k I&#39;d like to stay closer to 20k but I&#39;d go 30k for the perfect fit.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Lease or Buy:<\/strong> Buy<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>New or used:<\/strong> Looking primarily new but used is very much an option, too.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Type of vehicle:<\/strong> small\/mid-sized sedan<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Must haves:<\/strong> Push Start, Proximity Key Entry, Android Auto, Dual-zone Climate Control, Adaptive Cruise Control, Lane Keep Assist<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Desired transmission:<\/strong> Automatic<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Intended use:<\/strong> Daily Driver.

That&#39;s definitely a contender now. <\/p>\n\n<p>Corvette: This is my ideal car for so many reasons, some of which I can&#39;t actually share.

Another time, my sweet prince. <\/p>\n\n<p>Mustang: interior quality is the main concern holding me back. Otherwise, love the idea of a GT, especially with the 10-speed. Unfortunately I&#39;m one of those guys that is either V8 or nothing when it comes to the muscle cars so that does limit me a bit. Love the exterior, would be willing to tolerate road noise for the tradeoff of V8 noises. Doesn&#39;t seem like new ones can come down low enough so would have to wait for the right used one to come along. <\/p>\n\n<p>Camaro: ZL1 is the only model that gets me super excited as far as styling goes and it&#39;s well out of price range. Could tolerate the others but like the Mustang I start out of my price range on new ones due to V8 and then adding a few options gets it even further away. For some reason I don&#39;t see too many of the latest gen on the used market around me. It&#39;s mostly the fifth gens, which I don&#39;t care for. Maybe the sixth gens haven&#39;t depreciated as much yet. <\/p>\n\n<p>Challenger: almost immediately throwing this one out because FCA reliability and the lack of the 10-speed that people rave about. Maybe you guys can tell me if that&#39;s a mistake? <\/p>\n\n<p>Miata\/BRZ\/86: Could actually tolerate the lower power but everyone says these cars suck with autos and I&#39;m just not willing to drive a manual with my commute (&gt;60 miles, little over an hour in fast traffic, and traffic can get really shitty really fast if I leave work late). <\/p>\n\n<p>Golf GTI: aware of the option but not huge on the looks so holding off on investigating. <\/p>\n\n<p>Toyota Anything: Toyota&#39;s exterior styling on pretty much all of their cars right now strikes me as pretty bad. <\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Is this your 1st vehicle:<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>No<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Do you need a Warranty:<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Would be great but not necessary. <\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> (fluids, alternator, battery, brake pads etc)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Yes<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> (engine and transmission, timing belt\/chains, body work, suspension etc )<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>No<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Additional Notes:<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>As you can probably tell from the cars considered, I&#39;m open to both 2 and 4 seaters.
