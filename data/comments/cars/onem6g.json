I want something with more power than my miata, but do not want to get into something super heavy like a challenger.

The Chrysler is more generic, but we see the savings of $7,500 Tax credit + the initial 30 miles being electric.  <\/p>\n\n<p>We  don&#39;t drive more than 30 miles on an average day anyways, so my thought process on the Pacifica is if we are almost always driving those 30 miles and charge every night, we would save money. In fact, I used one of those websites to compare fuel costs with the Kia Carnival, which assumed I drove 30 miles a day and the annual savings would come out to almost $1,000. This over the course of 10 years or however long I own these cars is obviously a lot. And after the $7,500 tax credit the Pacifica would come out a few thousand cheaper as well.  <\/p>\n\n<p>If the price was all the same I would probably choose the Kia. So I&#39;m just wondering how practical is my math with the Hybrid? A friend of mine told me those numbers sound right in  theory, but in practice won&#39;t likely happen.

I think the Tacoma lacks creature comforts and passenger space, but makes up for it with the lower price ($40k for a TRD Off-Road long box) and utility capabilities.  The Wrangler wins with fuel economy, interior room (I&#39;m 6&#39;1&quot; and just fit in a 2020+ Tacoma without a sunroof), rear passenger space, and the &quot;fun&quot; factor of being a convertible, but the cheapest optioned up vehicle I&#39;d be willing to live with is $55k from a bulk dealer (plus the $7500 tax credit).  I&#39;ve considered trading in my Corvette and going all-out on a Rubicon, but that obviously comes with the drawback of no longer owning a fast manual sports car (which is also sort of a win with insurance costs and garage space).<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Location:<\/strong> Minnesota<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Price range:<\/strong> $30k - $60k.
