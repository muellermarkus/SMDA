I picked up the Stingray back in march before the market exploded and can make a little on the top with a trade-in. I bought the Corvette with the intention of having an automatic for my now often hour-long one-way commutes through LA traffic. Turns out, even with the mag ride suspension, it\u2019s not terribly comfortable and I just cannot get the driver seat to agree with my lower back after 45 minutes. It\u2019s also no fun having 460 horsepower when there is 0 opportunity to use it day-to-day. As much as I love this car, I\u2019m admittedly side-eyeing some newer German coupes with the hopes of maintaining some semblance of a fun driving dynamic that\u2019s way more livable for the 10-12 hours I\u2019m stuck in traffic every week. Found a couple M Performance Pack 440i\u2019s on Cars.com for under $40k, though if I stretch my budget, I can get a newer S5 for around $45k.<\/p>\n\n<p>The other end of the spectrum is that the Corvette is flattening out on its depreciation curve (and will likely hold its value better\/longer given the current availability of the C8 and split opinions on it), whereas a 2018+ German car still has a bit more to go. Then there\u2019s reliability.

Had an exhaust too which sounded great, but the infotainment system REALLY put me off. It&#39;s stupid and just does not work well with a new phone. Good price on the car and it drove way way better than I thought. And I know it&#39;s gonna be reliable but I can&#39;t get over the infotainment in that car.<\/p>\n\n<p>2014-15 Subaru Forester 2.0XT. Looks awesome, interior is nicer than I expected, and it felt very solid. Only issue is it was truly underwhelming to drive. The CVT ruined it for me, even though I knew there was a good sporty motor under the hood. Really underwhelmed. Couldn&#39;t pull the trigger on it even though it was in great shape.<\/p>\n\n<p>Infiniti Q50 AWD 3.7: This car was way quicker than I anticipated, the engine is a gem. Steering was heavy and communicative. That&#39;s where the praise ends though. The rest of the vehicle felt like a biscuit when it comes to quality. Not sure if it was the car I drove or if all Infinitis don&#39;t feel as good as they look. I was surprised, the car did not feel solid, from closing the door to the material used inside (they do not hold up well).<\/p>\n\n<p>VW Golf 1.8T TSI DSG (MK7). This was a 2018 model so it had all the new driver&#39;s assist systems as well as the new infotainment screen with apple car play and so on. Great car. What a fantastic driving car. I was so surprised that this is how a &quot;regular&quot; Golf drove. The motor has a lot of torque where you want it and the DSG is excellent.<\/p>\n\n<p>VW Golf GTI (Mk7): As above but felt quicker and handled really well. The only reason I hesitated was it&#39;s FWD. Dunno if that should hold me back. Great car overall.
