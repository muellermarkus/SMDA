I&#39;m leaning towards the Accord, but something about Honda&#39;s hybrid i-mmd transmission just bothers me. Not in the end-user experience (in fact I liked it more during the test drive than the Camry), but just the technical implementation. Idk, the fact that the engine is just a generator for the electric motor and that&#39;s how they implement their &quot;e-cvt&quot; is just unconventional. Toyota OTOH definitely knows what they&#39;re doing with Hybrid implementation. At the end of the day, based on all the reviews it seems like Honda has put together a more fun-to-drive and overall better package, so that&#39;s why I&#39;m leaning that way. I also really dislike the look of the LE trim of the Camry, and I think the SE has lower gas mileage. I&#39;m also probably one of the few people who actually likes having a moonroof which doesn&#39;t come standard on any Camry trim. Maybe I shouldn&#39;t be concerned about the i-mmd?
