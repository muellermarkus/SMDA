Im also not looking for speeding tickets, or races just something that is fun\/sastifying to drive.

I can afford the LC500. It looks beautiful and I\u2019ve always wanted a coupe.

My mom is getting a new\/used car (need help choosing a SUV). We are in California, Price range 0-25k, buy, SUV. My mom doesn&#39;t do too much driving, really just drives occasionally and in the area. Car will be mainly just for her, not a family car or anything and few long trips (occasionally goes out camping). We are thinking something more new such as 2018-2019, and although our price cap is 0-25k we are looking for something reliable, low repair costs and repairs overall, a car that will last a long time. Please let me know any recommendations! Gas or HYBRID works well, no electric for current time being.
