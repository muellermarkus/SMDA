The two cars in question are Subarus: a 2005 Outback XT w\/ manual transmission, approaching 140K miles and I still owe about $1000 on the loan, and a 2009 WRX, close to 90K, fully paid off for a couple years now. Both have had timing belt done recently. Outback has a year-old clutch, WRX is stiff and will probably need to be replaced fairly soon, and it needs summer tires, so I&#39;m looking at dropping a few thousand dollars basically no matter what.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Plan was to sell both cars now that I&#39;m not driving as many miles as I used to, get into a lease for about the same cost that we&#39;re currently carrying to keep the Outback on the road (that&#39;s between payments, which are almost done, and all the wear-and-tear stuff that&#39;s been replaced in the last couple of years), keep the chunk of change we get from the sales as an emergency fund while we pay down the new loan. Then I get the flexibility to try something new for a few years and figure out whether I want to buy out the lease, get into another lease, or buy something else entirely in 3 years&#39; time, when we&#39;ll have more money saved up to throw at another car as a down payment if we want to go that route. The issue is that I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m going to find anything I like as much as the WRX within reason. Maybe it just makes more sense to sock away $3-400\/month as long as it&#39;s on the road and hope it lasts me a few more years without a catastrophe before revisiting the lease-or-buy question again?<\/p>\n<\/div>","18":"<div class=\"md\"><p>To make a long story short I need to buy a new car because the frame on my Ford Five Hundred is rotten. <\/p>\n\n<p>I hit a pot hole while following a friend and I saw it too late.

I&#39;m 6&#39;3&quot; and 195lb, so I&#39;m used to not fitting that well in smaller cars. I don&#39;t have chronic back pain in general, and I&#39;ve owned a few cars that were very comfortable on road trips (a 1996 Tercel and a 2005 Acura TL), so I don&#39;t think it&#39;s just that I don&#39;t like driving long distances. I&#39;m uncomfortable in our 1999 Rav4 and 2001 MR2 Spyder as well, but that&#39;s to be expected because both are small. So, I&#39;m placing a good chunk of blame on the CX-5&#39;s seats. My wife doesn&#39;t have any complaints, but they&#39;re agony for me unless I&#39;m just driving around town. I want something that will be very comfortable on trips, can hold our dog crate and a few friends, and  doesn&#39;t drive like a boat on stilts. <\/p>\n<\/div>","63":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: USA<\/p>\n\n<p>Price Range: up to 15k, anything I save will go into mods<\/p>\n\n<p>Used only<\/p>\n\n<p>Type: Sports coupe or roadster<\/p>\n\n<p>Must haves: Respond well to mods, RWD<\/p>\n\n<p>Transmission: Manual only<\/p>\n\n<p>Intended use: Weekend car\/project car<\/p>\n\n<p>Considered vehicles: things like S2000, BRZ\/FR-S, MX-5, 350z, Supra, MR2, etc<\/p>\n\n<p>Not first vehicle<\/p>\n\n<p>No warranty<\/p>\n\n<p>Can do minor work<\/p>\n\n<p>Other notes:\nI won&#39;t be buying this for another couple years or so but I&#39;d like to start saving.

I was leaning more toward the Tucson, but pricing for the Soul may have me going the other way. How much space in back (including with seats down) am I losing between the Tucson and the Soul? Is there something remarkable about the Tucson that makes it worth the extra few thousand? The Soul is toward the bottom of my range (found an offer for $12,998 for a &#39;14 with 16k on it), and the Tucson is toward the top (found an offer for a &#39;16 for $14,999 with 32k on it).<\/p>\n<\/div>","89":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[gel\u00f6scht]<\/p>\n<\/div>","90":"<div class=\"md\"><p>2006 Subaru Baja, $11k with 92k miles. 5 speed.\nVS\nBMW 525i wagon, $4.8k with 104k miles.
