I&#39;ve test driven all at least once.<\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve also done my research on money factors and residual values and I think the Cadillac could be a really great deal with some negotiation and their money factors at close to 0%. Toyota&#39;s mf and residuals make it a poor lease option. The Honda would be an ok lease but I&#39;m not confident I can knock more than a couple thousand off the list price. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Is this your 1st vehicle:<\/strong> no<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you need a Warranty:<\/strong>  Would like a warranty for entire lease<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> (fluids, alternator, battery, brake pads etc) yes<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> (engine and transmission, timing belt\/chains, body work, suspension etc ) no<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Additional Notes:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>So is there another car I should look into?

I have a Black 2020 Corolla Hybrid w\/ about a 8k miles in about 8 months of ownership. I have had plenty of issues w\/ this Toyota: the Head-Unit has been problematic (replaced, factory reset, etc), the fuel computer doesn&#39;t measure accurately, my wifi hotspot took 2 months to fix, bluetooth doesn&#39;t handle my calls properly, and the door has a rattling noise that Toyota refuses to fix.<\/p>\n\n<p>All the dealerships I deal with have been a problem one way or another.

The cayman was great at my old place of residence...not so much here. Good, but not great..and the 335i is actually a fair amount better because of the weight and slightly smaller tires.   <\/p>\n\n<p>So I&#39;m at a crossroads. I loooove the cayman and it works amazing.

And maybe save up for a SUV or 4wd drive in the next year or two<br\/>\n- Sell\/trade the cayman and pick up the viper (specifically looking at a supercharged 2004 viper with 20k miles) and a 2016-17 Benz\/BMW as my &quot;winter&quot; car (it&#39;d be used more than just the winter obviously..but it&#39;d be more of my daily probably...and specifically, i&#39;m looking at a CLS550, 340i, 440,
