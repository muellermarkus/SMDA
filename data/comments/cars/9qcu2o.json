Off-lease 2017 GLS 450s are plentiful, with prices around $50,000 for one with 30,000 or so miles. They come very well equipped. <\/p>\n\n<p>A new VW Atlas SEL Premium carries a sticker price almost exactly that amount. Leftover 2018\u2019s in dealer inventories can likely be purchased for a few thousand less. <\/p>\n\n<p>Both are spacious inside, with comfortable seating for 6-7, which is what I need. The Mercedes is a bit longer and taller, and the VW is a bit wider. The Mercedes is much more powerful, but also heavier and requires premium fuel. <\/p>\n\n<p>I expect to keep the vehicle for around five years and 50-60,000 miles. I usually like to buy used to minimize the depreciation hit, but I\u2019ve never owned a Mercedes before and I\u2019m a bit worried that maintenance and repair costs may end up overwhelming the depreciation savings. The VW will still be under warranty for the entire projected period of ownership. The Mercedes warranty will run out about two years from my purchase date, so any repairs beyond then will be on my dime. <\/p>\n\n<p>Any experiences and thoughts would be appreciated.<\/p>\n<\/div>","23":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Hello everyone,<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Location:<\/strong> Saudi Arabia<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Price range:<\/strong> No Minimum.

The vehicles I have already considered  are based solely on what I like look wise, and what I am partial to personally. I spent some time in Germany and really loved the Volkswagens there but otherwise I&#39;m not partial. I used to own a Mazda 626 when I was in college and really enjoyed driving it so, I was looking at Mazdas. I currently own a 2006 chevy malibu maxx that won&#39;t pass inspection without $1500 or more of work - and even beyond that there are all kinds of things breaking in it - so I&#39;m entertaining the idea of buying or leasing a car.

Looking to replace my 2010 outback which I&#39;m tired of bringing to the shop for nonsense issues such as failed steering fluid pump, CV boots, window motor etc. Today&#39;s new Sienna hasn&#39;t been redesigned since 2011, and isn&#39;t doing well in today&#39;s small overlap test for the price of a new van. Pickups seems nice, but again I&#39;m finding Toyota&#39;s truck designs to be pretty crappy and outdated for the price of new, save for new standard safety features which I appreciate.
