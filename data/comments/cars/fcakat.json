I am pretty sure I am getting a Subaru BRZ and basically have two options. I can either buy a used 2019 BRZ Series.Grey or a New BRZ tS.<\/p>\n\n<p>The BRZ Series.Grey has 12,000 miles on it and will cost me $30000. The dealer is in Virginia so I&#39;ll have to pay for $350 in shipping. Plus the additional tax and fees the car comes down to around $31,000. The car is in great condition and is Subaru certified with 3 more years of warranty.<\/p>\n\n<p>(There is another BRZ Series.Grey in Houston that has only 10,000 miles for $27,000 which is ideal, but the owner of the dealership refuses to do the paperwork via mail and insisted me to be present to buy the car. As a college student I don&#39;t really have the time to fly all the way to Texas and back just for the car, so thats pretty much out of the picture unless he changes his mind)\nThe 2020 BRZ ts is also a limited edition, and there are multiple available here in Los Angeles for $33,000.<\/p>\n\n<p>Personally I prefer the color of the Series.Grey over the 2020 tS (White kinda looks boring for me, and the red interior of the 2020 model is honestly kinda out of place) but I don&#39;t know if it is worth it to only save $3000 for a 12,000 mile used car when I can spend $3000 more for a new and slightly better car.<\/p>\n\n<p>Another thing is that the Series.Grey is rarer than the tS and the dealer said it will keep its value.<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you guys help me decide which is the better option?

This is a reversal from when we bought our cars, when she had a much longer commute and I had a shorter one.<\/p>\n\n<p>She has the BMW 135i, which I drove for a while, until she got frustrated that she didn&#39;t get to drive her car. I have a 2013 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited, which has been great to me but I&#39;m racking up miles like crazy. I don&#39;t expect to do this commute forever, but we promised each other whomever has a crappy commute should enjoy the car they&#39;re in. The Jeep just isn&#39;t built for this.

I&#39;ve never owned a sports car before, and I have no clue what I&#39;m actually going to like so I&#39;m trying a little bit of everything. The Porsche stood out to me, but am I going to hate pouring miles onto the thing? The Mustang GT seems practical as a daily driver, but it didn&#39;t really excite me driving around. The Model 3 seems like the best case, but it&#39;s stupid expensive and I&#39;d have to figure out how to charge it every night in a house I am renting (i.e. paying for a 240V drop in the garage). <\/p>\n\n<p>Please help me decide. My friends with manuals said an 80 mile commute with stop-and-go traffic is no time to learn a manual, so that&#39;s about the only thing off the table. My wife also recommended I see the new ISF, but something about Lexus and sports cars doesn&#39;t seem right.<\/p>\n<\/div>","85":"<div class=\"md\"><p>\u2022 Location: (Specify your country or region) Midwest US<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Price range: (Minimum-Maximum in your local currency) ~30k US total<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Lease or Buy:buy<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 New or used: either, usually used <\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Type of vehicle: looking for two cars.
