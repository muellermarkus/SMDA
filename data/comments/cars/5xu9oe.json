The nicest 2008 g35s are all closer to 13 or 14k, and I&#39;m really uneasy about financing a 9 year old car on a tight budget. The Accord seems like the best of both worlds and yet I can&#39;t help but think &quot;what&#39;s the point&quot; of a v6 if all that power goes through the front wheels.<\/p>\n\n<p>Basically, talk me out of the g35 and into the Mazda, or vice versa.<\/p>\n<\/div>","1":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;m a teenager living in the US midwest. \nI&#39;m currently driving a 2002 Honda Accord that&#39;s having transmission issues. I expect I&#39;ll have to part with it soon, as the cost to fix said transmission issues will cost more than the car is worth. \nI&#39;d like to buy a niceish car that&#39;s fun to drive. I&#39;ve saved about 7k and would like to spend 5k or less on a car when the time comes. I&#39;m a teenager, so money is always tight to some extent and solid fuel efficiency would be nice. At the same time, I&#39;d love at least four seats so I can drive people around en masse. \nOf course, the first priority is speed and the car being fun to drive. <\/p>\n<\/div>","2":"<div class=\"md\"><p>-Location: US (Seattle)<\/p>\n\n<p>-Price: under $15k if my wife likes it enough, preferably under $12k<\/p>\n\n<p>-Type of vehicle: sports sedan\/coupe<\/p>\n\n<p>-Must haves: at least two doors but preferably 4, RWD or AWD, and either a stick or paddle shift type thing.<\/p>\n\n<p>-Intended use: daily driver, possibly track once in a while<\/p>\n\n<p>-Vehicles already considered: I&#39;ve been looking at an e92 328i.

I currently drive a 2014 Tundra that gets about 12 mpg, and I would like to keep the miles off it, as well as have a more practical solution to gas mileage. There are some options that are in the area, and I was wondering if I could get some input on what would be the best deal, what to look for, or what to avoid for these vehicles.

I prefer to do all my own maintenance on my vehicles.

So I was looking at those (not the Passat, but the little Eos...which I have never driven...and as I understand the backseat may be worthless - making it more or less a FWD NC Miata PRHT that is less fun!)   <\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m concerned about maintenance cost and reliability of each of those.  I&#39;m also worried about insurance as this will be a third car.  It&#39;s not hard to find a 70-80K Mile examples of the convertible version of each of those:<\/p>\n\n<p>Saab 9-3 Areo Convertible 2008-2009 ish <\/p>\n\n<p>BMW 330Ci 2004-2006ish (would love a ZHP - but those are harder to come by). <\/p>\n\n<p>Volkswagen Eos 2006-2009ish with the 2.0 TSI or (3.2 V6 if I can find one)<\/p>\n\n<p>Audi A4 Cabriolet quattro late B6\/early B7 ish <\/p>\n\n<p>Whatever it is, needs to be smallish.  It will be in the 3rd stall of my 3 car garage with a Jeep GC, and my wife and I&#39;s work shop area. <\/p>\n\n<p>I kind of want something a little more unique\/lux then the traditional american fare here in mid-Michigan.  Not a big fan of re-badge Japanese luxury brands....never really have been....and they are actually more common around here than one would think.  I wouldn&#39;t mind a Subaru Imperza WRX, but those are a bit more rare around here too.  <\/p>\n\n<p>I can turn a wrench a bit, and wouldn&#39;t mind something I can teach basic maintenance to my younigsh kids to (12 year old boy, 8 year old girl who has shown interest in tinkering). <\/p>\n\n<p>It would be something I&#39;d like to keep a long time as a part time summer car\/hobby car that I can daily when the weather is good, but if there is mid-Michigan snow\/rain in the forecast, I can take the truck. I&#39;m not a young man anymore, I&#39;m pushing 40, and wouldn&#39;t mind a nice cruiser.<\/p>\n\n<p>What says <a href=\"\/r\/cars\">r\/cars<\/a>? <\/p>\n<\/div>","92":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: Indiana<\/p>\n\n<p>Price range: 40k-50k<\/p>\n\n<p>New or used: Either, if used no older than 2015<\/p>\n\n<p>Type of vehicle: SUV<\/p>\n\n<p>Must haves: AWD, Fuel efficient, V6, Trunk space <\/p>\n\n<p>Intended use: Family Car<\/p>\n\n<p>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: Just starting to search, friends have recommended Toyota Highlander, Mazda CX-9, Volvo XC<\/p>\n\n<p>Is this your 1st vehicle:No, but it is the first vehicle I will be buying <\/p>\n\n<p>Does the vehicle need to have a warranty: No<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle: Fluids and battery<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle: No<\/p>\n\n<p>Additional Notes: This car will mostly be used for transporting kids to\/from school.

A quick background is that I am 30 y.o, committed but with no kids with an income of $80k a year. My credit rating is excellent but I do not want to pay over $500 a month for my vehicle. I drive very little on the weekends for errands. My daily commute is very short but where I live requires a lot of driving on the highway to get here and there. Sometimes I have to drive out to certain places for work which would add an extra 100-150 miles a month.. I would like to have a daily driver that I would not have to worry too much about. Right now I drive a beater and would like to upgrade. I am short (5&#39;1) so leg room is a non-issue but prefer SUVs as I like the height and I feel that I can see better driving them. Lastly, I would rarely have any passengers driving with me. <\/p>\n<\/div>","127":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: Boston\nPrice range: $600-700\/month lease or finance\nNew or used: Either\nType of vehicle: Hatchback, Sedan, or Coupe\nMust haves: Fast and fun to drive, AWD or RWD\nIntended use: Daily spirited driving\nVehicles you&#39;ve already considered: VW Golf R\nIs this your 1st vehicle: No\nDoes the vehicle need to have a warranty: Yes\nCan you do Minor work on your own vehicle: Yes\nCan you do Major work on your own vehicle: No\nAdditional Notes: Prefer manual, however i&#39;m willing to consider dual-clutch<\/p>\n<\/div>","128":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Location: Connecticut\nPrice range: Up to $28,000\nNew or used: Either\nType of vehicle: Sports car\/race car\nMust haves: AWD\nIntended use: daily driver\/fun car\nVehicles you&#39;ve already considered: wrx or evo\nIs this your 1st vehicle: No\nDoes the vehicle need to have a warranty: Preferably\nCan you do Minor work on your own vehicle: Yes\nCan you do Major work on your own vehicle: No\nAdditional Notes: I drive 22 miles a day to work and back.
