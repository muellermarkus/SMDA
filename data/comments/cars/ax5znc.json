class=\"md\"><p>Okay I ran numbers on all the cars I&#39;m looking at and came to the conclusion that I need to worry less about gas prices and more about depreciation, since that&#39;s clearly the biggest culprit with my money.  What I changed since last week: Trucks are off the menu.  Teslas are off the menu.  Budget has been reduced.  Option to keep my G8 is on the menu.<\/p>\n\n<p>Option 1: One-car garage - G8 GXP, Chevy SS, Cadillac CTS-V LSA.  Of those 3 all are available with a manual transmission.  RWD+manual+sedan seems to be a guarantee against depreciation.  The G8 GXP is cheaper than the SS and likely will be worth more in the future, but is less luxurious and less of a sleeper.  Probably would consider a shitbox winter beater in addition to this, but I&#39;d only pay insurance on one car at a time.  If I manage to get a closer job and run a winter beater, it means I&#39;m only putting about 6000-8000 miles per year on the car.  Basically it will last me for life.<\/p>\n\n<p>Option 2: Two-car garage keep G8 - Replace the Miata with a C5 Z06.  The C5 would be faster than anything I&#39;ve ever owned, but looking at its performance on tracks, it seems like it really isn&#39;t much faster than the sedans listed above.  But it is more fun, so there&#39;s that.  If I go this route I&#39;ll probably upgrade the G8 in a year or two to one of the cars above.  Also open to a winter shitbox.<\/p>\n\n<p>Option 3: Performance car plus shitbox - Porsche Cayman S, C6 Z06, 2015+ Mustang GT Performance Package, 2016+ Camaro SS 1LE + last-gen Honda Civic Si, Chevy Cobalt SS, Chevy Volt.  The C6 Z06 + Civic Si seems to be the best balance of comfort, performance, and low cost of ownership of the bunch.<\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;d say I&#39;m equally torn between all 3 of these options.  Feel free to list cars you think I&#39;d like.  <\/p>\n<\/div>","1":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Location:<\/strong> Germany  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Price range:<\/strong> 2,500\u20ac (Maybe 3000\u20ac if it&#39;s really good)  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Lease or Buy: Buy<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>New or used: Used<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Type of vehicle:<\/strong> Car, Sports Car  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Must haves:<\/strong> Reliable\/Low maintenance costs  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Desired transmission (auto\/manual, etc): Manual<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Intended use:<\/strong> Daily Driver, going out with friends and daily commute  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered: Toyota Celica, Mitsubishi Eclipse<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Is this your 1st vehicle: Yes<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you need a Warranty: No<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> Probably depending how minor  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you do Major work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> No  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Additional Notes:<\/strong> I like Japanese cars, and good quality German cars seem to be out of this price range<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<\/div>","2":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I was pretty late to the thread with this last week, so I&#39;ll repost it here for visibility:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Location:<\/strong> Kansas City, USA<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Price range:<\/strong> $30-40k<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Lease or Buy:<\/strong> Buy<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>New or Used:<\/strong> New or lightly used (under 25k miles)<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Type of Vehicle:<\/strong> Sport sedan\/hatchback, maybe a sporty crossover<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Must haves:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>AWD<\/li>\n<li>Modern driver assist features (blind-spot monitors, radar cruise control, etc)<\/li>\n<li>Quality sound system<\/li>\n<li>Nav, or at least Android Auto support<\/li>\n<li>Digital gauge cluster\/driver display (Not really a must-have, but I love that sort of techwank-y shit and would highly prefer it over something more plain)<\/li>\n<\/ul><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Desired transmission:<\/strong> Auto\/DCT, preferably no CVT but not a huge deal either way, just no manuals<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Intended use:<\/strong> Daily driver<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Vehicles you&#39;ve already considered:<\/strong> Kia Stinger GT, Audi S3, Volkswagen Golf R, Subaru WRX, Mazda CX-5 Turbo<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Is this your 1st vehicle:<\/strong> No<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Do you need a warranty:<\/strong> Yes<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Can you do minor work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> Never have before, but would like to get into it when I get a house with a garage in hopefully a couple years<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Can you do major work on your own vehicle:<\/strong> No<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Additional notes:<\/strong> I&#39;ve been working on tracking down a 2018 Stinger GT1 through a couple channels since Kia&#39;s been so aggressive with their rebates on them lately, and am fairly sure that&#39;s the direction I want to go at this point.

I live in the frozen tunda of Minnesota and am ready to move on from my 2002 Camry. The following things are crucial to me:<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Winter Features:<\/strong> I&#39;m looking for a car that has remote start (I understand I could install this after-market), heated seats, and is AWD. I&#39;ve read all the arguments that winter tires &gt; AWD, but my main issue having a Camry in Minnesota is getting going. There have been multiple occasions where my car gets stuck in the snow and I have to get pushed out due to the front tires spinning in deep snow\/icy side streets. I believe AWD would prevent this issue from happening. In my 10+ years of driving here, I&#39;ve never gotten into an accident due to sliding so, for me personally, I think AWD is more important than winter tires.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Affordability:<\/strong> I&#39;m looking for a used sedan that is under $20,000, between 2012 - 2017, and under 60,000-70,000 miles. I&#39;ve looked into multiple SUVS, but most that fit my criteria are above $20,000.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Reliability:<\/strong> I want a car that can withstand Minnesota winters and one that I won&#39;t be worrying about breaking down on me. I can do basic car maintenance via YouTube videos, but I do end up going to the shop for any bigger issues.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Design\/Look:<\/strong> This may be controversial, but, if I&#39;m spending almost $20,000 on something, I want to enjoying getting into the vehicle and driving it every day. There aren&#39;t a lot of compact SUVs that I like the looks of. Unfortunately, I feel this same way about the Subaru Crosstrek and Forester.<\/p>\n\n<p>With all this in mind, I&#39;ve narrowed my search down to a Ford Fusion or Buick Regal.

I also worry about road salt, which I&#39;ll have to deal with because I&#39;ll be trying to daily drive the car, but from what I understand I can mitigate the corrosion by getting some kind of underbody protectant and also by regularly taking the car to a car wash. <\/p>\n\n<p>There&#39;s also the deal that I&#39;d really prefer it if the car lasted me for 4 years through the rest of college.

My budget is about 10 to 20 grand (US dollars). I wanted something new, but if not at least late model, nothing over 50,000 miles, nothing more than 4 years old. I currently have a 2013 Prius and while it&#39;s been a good car and I love it, lots of little things have worn out on it, such as door lock actuators that cost $500 per door to fix. That&#39;s some costly shit right there and makes me want to steer clear of toyotas.<\/p>\n\n<p>My two biggest, major passions\/hobbies are Scuba diving and Road cycling. I&#39;d love something that I have plenty of room to put my scuba gear in and something I can have an expensive road bike in, locked away and out of the weather. Sure, a nice pickup with a camper shell would do great too, but pickups are fucking expensive as shit. Getting one with under 50k miles and less than 5 years old is going to be at least 24k and it will probably be some single cab fleet truck. Sure, the new Silverados look like sex on wheels (fuck they are pretty) but the fuckin&#39; things are 34,000 bucks. I&#39;m not the kind to make a $600 car payment every month until I&#39;m decently rich, which I&#39;m not yet.<\/p>\n\n<p>I would LOVE a mini Countryman, you can get them used with low miles for dirt cheap. When I was a kid my dream car was a mini. Something about that brand, I&#39;d just love to own one. But there is NO cargo room for shit that I need to transport. I love the Fiat 500x, it&#39;s everything the 500l should have been but wasn&#39;t. I could get a brand new one for under 20 grand and am still seriously considering it for the sheer coolness of the vehicle, but again... NO CARGO ROOM. Have I mentioned yet? I&#39;d love some cargo room, enclosed, to lock things up and keep them out of the weather. Also, when transporting people it would be nice for them not to be scrunched up and have to climb in and out like they do in the Prius...<\/p>\n\n<p>Enter, the Dodge Caravan... The GT model to be specific. It actually doesn&#39;t look too bad, it&#39;s kind of sporty. I had the chance to drive one around for a week as a rental and let me say, it has a GREAT feel to it. Plenty of cargo room, I could stand up several road bikes inside of it and still have room for people and equipment. Scuba equipment? No problem, tons of room. Haul people around when they visit? It&#39;s super roomy, easy to get into and out of and comfy. I don&#39;t do any 4 wheeling, I don&#39;t need a damn 4x4. I live in Florida and I&#39;ll be damned if I get off the asphalt here, unless I&#39;m getting in the water which I love and again, this fucking van can hold kayaks on top of it like a boss.<\/p>\n\n<p>Vans, once upon a time were cool. Now they&#39;re associated with children which I have none of and don&#39;t plan on anytime soon. I don&#39;t want a kid hauler but these things are everything I need out of a car and can be had with under 40k miles, in tip top condition, only a year or two old for 12-15 grand. It would be perfect for me and I could litter the back with all my awesome stickers. But I know this is stupid. I don&#39;t want to kill off any tiny ounce of self respect that still exists some where deep down within me.<\/p>\n\n<p>What should I do?<\/p>\n<\/div>","119":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Car choice mostly decided.

I&#39;ve lost 50 pounds on my journey to a healthier me, but the earth is still attracted to me with a force of 483 pounds.<\/p>\n\n<p>So the Model 3 and Model S were basically a non starter as I couldn&#39;t get in the doors. However I could get in and close the door for the Model X. Yet with the seat fully towards the floor, and at a comfortable angle; I still had to bend my neck forward at 5-10 degrees only to have it rub against the notched down rear ceiling. (I believe it is for the structure of the falcon doors).<\/p>\n\n<p>This leads me to my question for Reddit. I noticed that there was a large mechanism at the bottom of the driver&#39;s seat. Does anyone know of a replacement seat for this car that is slightly lower to the floor; i.e. has less of a mechanism for seat movement? Also any ideas on what companies to call to maybe have this modification done?<\/p>\n\n<p>I&#39;d really like to purchase this vehicle as this is my only issue with the car, but it is a big
