I was putting way too many miles on it. The chances of cracking the fiberglass clamshell increase heavily with that much driving.  \n2. I used to worry too much about parking, especially in crowded spaces.  \n3. Parallel parking behind big cars used to make me sweat.  \n4. It came at the cost of a lot of outings with friends as I could seat just one more.  \n5. The trunk is way too small. Works for me alone but if there are some things on my passenger, it becomes a pain to fit everything.  \n  \nI still miss driving it daily and look forward to the weekends. To be honest, zero hiccups in the 11k miles I have put on it so far except the routine oil change. It has been the most reliable car I have owned so far, probably dur to the Toyota innards.\n  \nI went through a lot of threads here and zeroed in on a Mazdaspeed 3 and a Ford Focus ST. I test drove a WRX but it went over my budget after taxes and addons. The Mazdaspeed 3 was good, but something seemed funny about the clutch and the dealer was trying his best to get rid of the car. Then drove the Focus ST and boy, is it a load of fun! Didn't have to test drive any other car because that sealed the deal.\n\nThanks guys for your suggestions on some of the threads here and the \"Weekly - What Car Should I Buy Megathread\", as it really helped in making the decision of getting a decent looking, fun andfast daily driver :)\n\nHere's a pic of it:
