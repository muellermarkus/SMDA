Regression analysis lets you create a model that predicts something based on its attributes. One of my first post-grad-school jobs was building regression models to predict the price of houses based on location, size, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, etc.\n\nI thought it might be fun to try to find good deals on a Lexus ES 300h using regression analysis. I wrote some code to scrape data from cars.com, ending up with 321 300h's for sale in the US. I used Excel to do the regression. The results are [here](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/QL1E4X4).\n\nFirst, the regression model is very good in the sense that it explains nearly all of the variation in prices (first image).\n\nSecond, the model looks like what you would expect. Trim level is defined as 0 for Base trim, 1 for Luxury and 2 for Ultra Luxury (there was only one of those). The price goes up $2457 for every year, i.e. a 2017 would be priced $2457 higher than a 2016, other things equal (like trim level and mileage). Price increases $3131 with higher trim level. Price *decreases* 0.08856 for every mile. Drive your car a mile and it's worth 9 cents less. (Second image)\n\nThird, the regression model identified a bunch of cars that were priced cheaper than the predicted price. The *residual* is the difference between the actual and predicted value. For the top row in (image 3), the actual price is $27,298 and the predicted price is $33,884. Subtracting the actual from the predicted yields the residual $6,586, implying that the actual price is $6,586 lower than it should be. *It's a bargain.* The data is sorted by residual price so all of the cars shown in (image 3) are bargains.\n\nI tried to corroborate the model by looking at KBB's estimates. The KBB price is what I found given the 300h's year and mileage (I couldn't figure out how to account for trim level). The KBB estimates are labelled \"KBB Price\" in the third image. The rightmost \"Discount\" column is the difference between the asking price and the KBB price. They pretty much correspond to the model's residual values, e.g. for row 2 the residual is $6,346 and the discount is $6575. It's interesting that for the older cars in table, the last 3 rows, the discount is considerably less than the residual, implying that the dealers listing on cars.com do a better job of pricing older vehicles.\n\nI'm not sure how practical this exercise is. It's based on a nationwide search. Maybe it makes sense to fly to Orlando to buy a car that's priced $6000 lower than it should be. There's a good chance that the car has some deficits that make the price appropriate, though. Dealers aren't stupid.\n\nMaybe the regression analysis would be useful if the model was applied to cars within 50 miles or so, so the shopper can easily check them out in person.\n\nDoes the model add value, though? Cars.com already applies its own model to identify \"Fair Deal\", \"Good Deal\" and \"Great Deal\" cars. This is N=1, but the site has a 2013 with 142K miles identified as a \"Great Deal\", $1,322 under market. The regression model says the price is $990 under market. \n\nWhich model is better? Probably cars.com's. They have a ton more data and they've doubtless honed it. I'll check a few more \"Great Deals\" to figure out if their evaluations are trustworthy.","27":"","28":"","29":"[entfernt]","30":"","31":"[entfernt]","32":"[entfernt]","33":"","34":"Hey all,\n\nI'm currently looking into sound modding this car into the game Assetto Corsa and was hoping I could find some tech-savvy people here.\n\nWhat I'm looking to understand is what's happening around 3:47 into this clip: [https:\/\/youtu.be\/lKExEVMqT\\_U?t=226](https:\/\/youtu.be\/lKExEVMqT_U?t=226) and I can't quite figure out what's happening.
